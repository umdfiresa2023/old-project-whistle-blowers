"business exxon mobil corporation was incorporated in the state of new jersey in 1882."
"divisions and affiliated companies of exxonmobil operate or market products in the united states and most other countries of the world."
"their principal business involves exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas and manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products."
"affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses."
"exxon mobil corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include exxonmobil, exxon, esso, mobil or xto."
"for convenience and simplicity, in this report the terms exxonmobil, exxon, esso, mobil and xto, as well as terms like corporation, company, our, we and its, are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates."
"the precise meaning depends on the context in question."
"the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive."
"there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers."
"the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes."
"operating data and industry segment information for the corporation are contained in the financial section of this report under the following: “quarterly information”, “note 18: disclosures about segments and related information” and “operating information”."
"information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report."
"exxonmobil has a long-standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology."
"we have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments."
"exxonmobil held over 13 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2019."
"for technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $79 million in 2019."
"although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our company, the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession."
"the number of regular employees was 74."
"9 thousand, 71."
"0 thousand, and 69."
"6 thousand at years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively."
"regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the corporation and are covered by the corporation’s benefit plans and programs."
"throughout exxonmobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground."
"these include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations."
"using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, exxonmobil’s 2019 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including exxonmobil’s share of equity company expenditures, were $5."
"2 billion, of which $4."
"0 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures."
"the total cost for such activities is expected to increase to approximately $5."
"9 billion in 2020 and 2021."
"capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately 35 percent of the total."
"information concerning the source and availability of raw materials used in the corporation’s business, the extent of seasonality in the business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to foreign operations may be found in “item 1a."
"risk factors” and “item 2."
"properties” in this report."
"exxonmobil maintains a website at exxonmobil."
"com."
"our annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13 of the securities exchange act of 1934 are made available through our website as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file or furnish the reports to the securities and exchange commission ."
"also available on the corporation’s website are the company’s corporate governance guidelines, code of ethics and business conduct, and additional policies as well as the charters of the audit, compensation, nominating, and other committees of the board of directors."

"1 item 1a."
"risk factorsexxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses."
"many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and operating results, or our financial condition."
"these risk factors include:  supply and demand the oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses."
"this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products."
"oil, gas, petrochemical, and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity."
"any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations, especially in the upstream segment, financial condition, and proved reserves."
"on the other hand, a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations, especially in the downstream and chemical segments."
"economic conditions."
"the demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad-based economic activities and levels of prosperity."
"the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results."
"other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, trade tariffs, security or public health concerns, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals."
"sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the european union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil."
"other demand-related factors."
"other supply-related factors."
"commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply."
"for example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand."
"similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products."
"world oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by countries to opec production quotas and other agreements among sovereigns, and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors’ operations, logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies."
"technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals."
"other market factors."
"exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions."
" government and political factors exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations."
"access limitations."
"a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, or may place resources off-limits from development altogether."
"restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices, when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital."
"many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin."
"restrictions on doing business."
"exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the united states or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted."
"such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions."
"lack of legal certainty."
"some countries in which we do business lack well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted, or may be unable to maintain, clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development."
"lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts."
"in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award."
"2 regulatory and litigation risks."
"legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate."
"security concerns."
"successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, and other local security concerns."
"such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time."
"climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions."
"due to concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"these include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy."
"such policies could make our products more expensive, less competitive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas."
"current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions."
"alternative energy."
"many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support transitioning to alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies."
"governments and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources."
"we are conducting our own research both in-house and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world, including the massachusetts institute of technology, princeton university, the university of texas, and stanford university."
"our research projects focus on developing algae-based biofuels, carbon capture and storage, breakthrough energy efficiency processes, advanced energy-saving materials, and other technologies."
"for example, exxonmobil is launching an innovative relationship with the u."
"s."
"department of energy’s national laboratory network to bring low-emission energy breakthroughs to commercial scale."
"our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a cost-competitive manner."
"see “operational and other factors” below."
" operational and other factorsin addition to external economic and political factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control."
"the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition."
"for projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control."
"exploration and development program."
"our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts."
"among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget."
"3 project and portfolio management."
"the long-term success of exxonmobil’s upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital intensive projects."
"these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency."
"in addition to the effective management of individual projects, exxonmobil’s success, including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders, depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio, including diversification among types and locations of our projects and strategies to divest assets."
"we may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategies."
"additionally, we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment and could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated."
"the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports."
"operational efficiency."
"an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance, especially given the commodity-based nature of many of our businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis."
"this requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio, and the recruitment, development, and retention of high caliber employees."
"research and development and technological change."
"to maintain our competitive position, especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement, exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"to remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies, including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large amounts of data to our businesses."
"safety, business controls, and environmental risk management."
"our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities, and to minimize the potential for human error."
"we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events."
"for example, we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and surveillance."
"similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities."
"we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework."
"substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended."
"cybersecurity."
"exxonmobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors including state-sponsored actors."
"exxonmobil’s defensive preparedness includes multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruptions; non-technological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and industry groups; internal training and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery."
"if the measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient, exxonmobil as well as our customers, employees, or third parties could be adversely affected."
"cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment; damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information being altered, lost, or stolen; result in employee, customer, or third-party information being compromised; or otherwise disrupt our business operations."
"we could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory actions, litigation or reputational harm."
"preparedness."
"our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, human error, and similar events."
"for example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas."
"our facilities are designed, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, including those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and earthquakes."
"our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce."
"our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning."
"4 insurance limitations."
"the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this item 1a is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient."
"competition."
"as noted in item 1 above, the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive."
"we face competition not only from other private firms, but also from state-owned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries and as partners with other private firms."
"in some cases, these state-owned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners, with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders, such as exxonmobil."
"technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of exxonmobil or reduce the need for resource-owning countries to partner with private-sector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources."
"reputation."
"our reputation is an important corporate asset."
"an operating incident, significant cybersecurity disruption, change in consumer views concerning our products, or other adverse event such as those described in this item 1a may have a negative impact on our reputation, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, obtain financing, or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products."
"exxonmobil’s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole."
"projections, estimates, and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1, 1a, 2, 7 and 7a of this report are forward-looking statements."
"actual future results, including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures, costs, and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report."
" item 1b."
"unresolved staff commentsnone."

"propertiesinformation with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows:  1."
"disclosure of reserves a."
"summary of oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019 the table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies."
"natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels."
"the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period."
"no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31, 2019, that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date."
"6 in the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately."
"however, the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries."
"the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity."
"however, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in item 1a."
"risk factors."
"the estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures."
"furthermore, the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves."
"although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price levels."
"in addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects."
"b."
"technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2019 additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2019 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results."
"data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information."
"the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality 3-d and 4-d seismic data, calibrated with available well control information."
"the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data analysis packages."
"in some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates."
"c."
"qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves and resources group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization."
"primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves."
"this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas."
"in addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates."
"the manager of the global reserves and resources group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in engineering and currently serves on the oil and gas reserves committee of the society of petroleum engineers ."
"the group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines."
"this group includes individuals who hold degrees in either engineering or geology."
"the global reserves and resources group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates."
"appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database."
"an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit."
"key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long-standing approval guidelines."
"no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization."
"in addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database."
"endorsement by the global reserves and resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process."
"after all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement."
"7 2."
"proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2019, approximately 7."
"7 billion oil-equivalent barrels of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped."
"this represents 34 percent of the 22."
"4 goeb reported in proved reserves."
"this compares to the 7."
"9 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2018."
"during the year, exxonmobil conducted development activities that resulted in the transfer of approximately 0."
"9 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end."
"the largest transfers were related to development activities in the united states, the united arab emirates, and kazakhstan."
"during 2019, extensions and discoveries, primarily in the united states and guyana, resulted in an addition of 1."
"5 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves, along with an increase of 0."
"6 goeb due to revisions primarily in asia."
"also, the corporation reclassified approximately 1."
"4 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met the sec definition of proved reserves, primarily in the united states, which was offset by the extensions in the united states referenced above."
"overall, investments of $18."
"3 billion were made by the corporation during 2019 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, including $17."
"7 billion for oil and gas producing activities, along with additional investments for other non-oil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities."
"these investments represented 78 percent of the $23."
"5 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures."
"one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves."
"exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed."
"development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects."
"proved undeveloped reserves in the united states, canada, australia, and kazakhstan have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects."
"the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price levels."
"of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries."
"in canada, proved undeveloped reserves are related to drilling activities in the offshore hebron field and onshore cold lake operations."
"in australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the gorgon jansz lng project."
"in kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production license in the tengiz - korolev field complex."
"the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress."

"41management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment and risk assessment long-term business outlook the long-term business outlook is based on the corporation’s 2019 outlook for energy, which is used to help inform our long term business strategies and investment plans."
"by 2040, the world’s population is projected at around 9."
"2 billion people, or about 1."
"6 billion more than in 2017."
"coincident with this population increase, the corporation expects worldwide economic growth to average close to 3 percent per year, with economic output nearly doubling by 2040."
"as economies and populations grow, and as living standards improve for billions of people, the need for energy is expected to continue to rise."
"even with significant efficiency gains, global energy demand is projected to rise by about 20 percent from 2017 to 2040."
"this increase in energy demand is expected to be driven by developing countries ) ."
"as expanding prosperity helps drive global energy demand higher, increasing use of energy efficient technologies and practices as well as lower-emission products will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and emissions per unit of economic output over time."
"substantial efficiency gains are likely in all key aspects of the world’s economy through 2040, affecting energy requirements for power generation, transportation, industrial applications, and residential and commercial needs."
"global electricity demand is expected to increase approximately 60 percent from 2017 to 2040, with developing countries likely to account for about 85 percent of the increase."
"consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to remain the largest and fastest growing major segment of global primary energy demand, supported by a wide variety of energy sources."
"the share of coal fired generation is likely to decline substantially and approach 25 percent of the world’s electricity in 2040, versus nearly 40 percent in 2017, in part as a result of policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address the risks related to climate change."
"from 2017 to 2040, the amount of electricity supplied using natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables is likely to grow by two thirds, accounting for the entire growth in electricity supplies and offsetting the reduction of coal."
"electricity from wind and solar is likely to increase about 400 percent, helping total renewables to account for about 75 percent of the increase in electricity supplies worldwide through 2040."
"total renewables will likely reach nearly 40 percent of global electricity supplies by 2040."
"natural gas and nuclear are also expected to increase shares over the period to 2040, reaching almost 30 percent and about 15 percent of global electricity supplies respectively by 2040."
"supplies of electricity by energy type will reflect significant differences across regions reflecting a wide range of factors including the cost and availability of various energy supplies and policy developments."
"energy for transportation – including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes – is expected to increase more than 25 percent from 2017 to 2040."
"transportation energy demand is likely to account for approximately 60 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide over this period."
"light-duty vehicle demand for liquid fuels is projected to peak prior to 2025 and then decline to levels seen in the early-2010s by 2040 as the impact of better fuel economy and significant growth in electric cars, led by china, europe, and the united states, work to offset growth in the worldwide car fleet of about 70 percent."
"by 2040, light-duty vehicles are expected to account for about 20 percent of global liquid fuels demand."
"during the same time period, nearly all the world’s transportation fleets are likely to continue to run on liquid fuels, which are widely available and offer practical advantages in providing a large quantity of energy in small volumes."
"liquid fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today reflecting broad-based availability, affordability, ease of transportation, and fitness as a practical solution to meet a wide variety of needs."
"by 2040, global demand for liquid fuels is projected to grow to approximately 114 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of about 16 percent from 2017."
"the non-oecd share of global liquid fuels demand is expected to increase to about 65 percent by 2040, as liquid fuels demand in the oecd is likely to decline by close to 10 percent."
"much of the global liquid fuels demand today is met by crude production from traditional conventional sources; these supplies will remain important, and significant development activity is expected to offset much of the natural declines from these fields."
"at the same time, a variety of emerging supply sources – including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids and biofuels – are expected to grow to help meet rising demand."
"the world’s resource base is sufficient to meet projected demand through 2040 as technology advances continue to expand the availability of economic and lower carbon supply options."
"however, timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable and affordable supplies."
"natural gas is a low-emission, versatile and practical fuel for a wide variety of applications, and it is expected to grow the most of any primary energy type from 2017 to 2040, meeting more than 40 percent of global energy demand growth."
"global natural gas demand is expected to rise about 35 percent from 2017 to 2040, with about half of that increase coming from the asia pacific region."
"significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas – the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock formations – will help meet these needs."
"in total, about 60 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources."
"at the same time, conventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of global supply, meeting more than two thirds of worldwide demand in 2040."
"liquefied natural gas trade will expand significantly, meeting about 40 percent of the increase in global demand growth, with much of this supply expected to help meet rising demand in asia pacific."
"42management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the world’s energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through 2040."
"oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy with its share remaining close to 30 percent in 2040."
"coal is currently the second largest source of energy, but it is likely to lose that position to natural gas in the 2020-2025 timeframe."
"the share of natural gas is expected to reach about 25 percent by 2040, while the share of coal falls to about 20 percent."
"nuclear power is projected to grow significantly, as many nations are likely to expand nuclear capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and environmental issues."
"total renewable energy is likely to exceed 15 percent of global energy by 2040, with biomass, hydro and geothermal contributing a combined share of more than 10 percent."
"total energy supplied from wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase rapidly, growing nearly 250 percent from 2017 to 2040, when they will likely be just over 5 percent of the world energy mix."
"the corporation anticipates that the world’s available oil and gas resource base will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from increases in previously discovered fields."
"technology will underpin these increases."
"the investments to develop and supply resources to meet global demand through 2040 will be significant – even if demand remains flat."
"this reflects a fundamental aspect of the oil and natural gas business as the international energy agency describes in its world energy outlook 2019."
"according to the iea’s stated energy policies scenario, the investment required to meet oil and natural gas supply requirements worldwide over the period 2019-2040 will be about $20 trillion ."
"in the iea’s sustainable development scenario, which is in line with the objectives of the paris agreement on climate change, the investment need would still accumulate to $13 trillion."
"international accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse gas emissions continue to evolve with uncertain timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact."
"for many years, the corporation has taken into account policies established to reduce energy related greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term outlook for energy."
"the climate accord reached at the conference of the parties in paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging."
"our outlook reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the aggregation of nationally determined contributions, which were submitted by signatories to the united nations framework convention on climate change 2015 paris agreement."
"our outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate related policies, which often target specific sectors."
"it estimates potential impacts of these policies on consumer energy demand by using various assumptions and tools – including, depending on the sector, application of a proxy cost of carbon or assessment of targeted policies ."
"for purposes of the outlook, a proxy cost on energy-related co2 emissions is assumed to reach about $80 per tonne in 2040 in oecd nations."
"china and other leading non-oecd nations are expected to trail oecd policy initiatives."
"nevertheless, as people and nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will continue to need practical solutions that do not jeopardize the affordability or reliability of the energy they need."
"practical solutions to the world’s energy and climate challenges will benefit from market competition in addition to well-informed, well-designed, and transparent policy approaches that carefully weigh costs and benefits."
"such policies are likely to help manage the risks of climate change while also enabling societies to pursue other high priority goals around the world – including clean air and water, access to reliable, affordable energy, and economic progress for all people."
"all practical and economically-viable energy sources, both conventional and unconventional, will need to be pursued to continue meeting global energy demand, recognizing the scale and variety of worldwide energy needs as well as the importance of expanding access to modern energy to promote better standards of living for billions of people."
"the information provided in the long-term business outlook includes exxonmobil’s internal estimates and forecasts based upon internal data and analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources including the international energy agency."
" upstream exxonmobil continues to sustain a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which enables the corporation to be selective, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks."
"exxonmobil’s fundamental strategies guide our global upstream business, including capturing material and accretive opportunities to continually high-grade the resource portfolio, selectively developing attractive oil and natural gas resources, developing and applying high-impact technologies, and pursuing productivity and efficiency gains."
"these strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational excellence, development of our employees, and investment in the communities within which we operate."
"as future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced."
"based on current investment plans, oil-equivalent production from the americas is expected to increase to be a majority of total production over the next several years."
"further, the proportion of our global production from unconventional, deepwater, and lng resource types currently contributes nearly half of global production, and is expected to grow to be about 60 percent in the next few years."
"43management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity."
"however, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in item 1a."
"risk factors."
"the markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility."
"exxonmobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity, technology advances, consumer preference and government policies."
"on the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of opec and other large government resource owners, and other factors."
"to manage the risks associated with price, exxonmobil evaluates annual plans and major investments across a range of price scenarios."
"in 2019, the upstream business produced 4."
"0 million oil-equivalent barrels per day."
"the corporation continued to have exploration success in guyana and cyprus, and also made strategic acreage acquisitions in argentina, brazil, greece, egypt, and namibia."
"in the more mature conventional operations, our primary goal is to maximize cash flow generation through exxonmobil’s world-class workforce and best practices in reliability and project execution."
"as a result, assets in russia, indonesia, kazakhstan, and the united arab emirates all recorded their highest daily production rates to-date."
" downstream exxonmobil’s downstream is a large, diversified business with global logistics, trading, refining, and marketing."
"the corporation has a presence with established markets in the americas and europe, as well as in the growing asia pacific region."
"exxonmobil’s fundamental downstream business strategies competitively position the company across a range of market conditions."
"these strategies include targeting best in class operations in all aspects of the business, maximizing value from advanced technologies, capitalizing on integration across exxonmobil businesses, selectively investing for resilient, advantaged returns, operating efficiently and effectively, and providing quality, valued and differentiated products and services to customers."
"exxonmobil’s operating results, as noted in item 2."
"properties, reflect 21 refineries, located in 14 countries, with distillation capacity of 4."
"7 million barrels per day and lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity of 129 thousand barrels per day."
"exxonmobil’s fuels and lubes value chains have significant global reach, with multiple channels to market serving a diverse customer base."
"our portfolio of world-renowned brands includes exxon, mobil, esso, synergy, and mobil 1."
"demand for products grew 1 million barrels per day or about 1 percent in 2019, but was outpaced by global refining capacity, which expanded by about 1."
"8 million barrels per day, resulting in weaker refining margins."
"canadian crude differentials narrowed in 2019 as alberta imposed limits on crude production, which resulted in lower refinery margins in canada and the midwest region of the u."
"s."
"new pipeline capacity in the permian reduced the crude differentials between midland and houston."
"in the near term, we expect to continue to see variability in refining margins following the dynamics of the supply/demand balance."
"refining margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials and the market prices for the range of products produced ."
"crude oil and many products are widely traded with published prices, including those quoted on multiple exchanges around the world ."
"prices for these commodities are determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many factors, including global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, industry refinery operations, import/export balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal demand, weather, and political climate."
"exxonmobil’s long term outlook is that industry refining margins will remain volatile subject to the pace of new capacity growth relative to global demand growth."
"exxonmobil’s integration including logistics, trading, refining, and marketing enhances our ability to generate returns across the value chain in both fuels and lubricants businesses."
"as described in more detail in item 1a."
"risk factors, proposed carbon policy and other climate related regulations in many countries, as well as the continued growth in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the downstream business."
"44management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the downstream portfolio is continually evaluated during all parts of the business cycle, and numerous asset divestments have been made over the past decade."
"when investing in the downstream, exxonmobil remains focused on selective and resilient projects."
"the three key projects that started up at the end of 2018 have added incremental earnings in 2019 to the downstream by upgrading resid and intermediates into high value clean products and basestocks."
"four other strategic projects have been approved during the first half of 2019."
"exxonmobil continues to grow its product sales in new markets near major production assets with continued progress on the mexico and indonesia market entries."
"the lubricants business continues to grow, leveraging world class brands and integration with industry leading basestock refining capability."
"through the mobil branded properties, such as mobil 1, mobil is the worldwide leader among synthetic motor oils."
" chemical exxonmobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products."
"exxonmobil sustains its competitive advantage through continued operational excellence, investment and cost discipline, a balanced portfolio of products, and integration with downstream and upstream operations, all underpinned by proprietary technology."
"demand for chemical products continued to grow in 2019."
"polyolefin and aromatics product margins were however further impacted by capacity additions outpacing global demand growth."
"over the long term, demand for chemical products is forecast to outpace growth in global gdp and energy demand for the next two decades."
"exxonmobil estimates that global demand for chemicals will rise by approximately 45 percent by 2030, driven by continued global growth of the middle class."
"exxonmobil’s integration with refining, together with unparalleled project execution capacity, enhances our ability to generate industry-leading returns across a range of market environments."
"these competitive advantages enable us to continue to invest in projects that are robust to the chemical market cycles."
"in 2019, we started up the expansion of the polyethylene plant in beaumont, texas ahead of schedule, capitalizing on advantaged feedstock and energy supplies in north america."

" listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms."
" entitlements - net interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors."
"these factors consist of net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession."
"once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices."
" entitlements - price, spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors."
"these factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another."
"according to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil."
"for example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover its costs."
"these effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas."
"such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements."
" quotas are changes in exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries ."
"volumes reported in this category would have been readily producible in the absence of the quota."
" divestments are reductions in exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration."
" growth and other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil."
"such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements."

"cash that may be available as surplus to the corporation’s immediate needs is carefully managed through counterparty quality and investment guidelines to ensure it is secure and readily available to meet the corporation’s cash requirements, and to optimize returns."
"to support cash flows in future periods the corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production."
"after a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields eventually to produce at declining rates for the remainder of their economic life."
"decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field."
"in particular, the corporation’s key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time."
"furthermore, the corporation’s net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms."
"the corporation has long been successful at offsetting the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project execution."
"the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity."
"however, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; and changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment."

"the corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall political and technical risks of the corporation’s upstream segment and associated cash flow."
"further, due to its financial strength, debt capacity and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the corporation’s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fixed commitments."
"the corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade."
"because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses."
"additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time."
"key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations."
"acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s common stock, or both."
"exxonmobil closely monitors the potential impacts of brexit and interbank offered rate reforms, including libor, under a number of scenarios and has taken steps to mitigate their potential impact."

"accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period."
"in the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of products sold."
"refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refiner pays for its raw materials and the market prices for the range of products produced."
"these prices in turn depend on global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations, import/export balances and weather."

"such conditions, along with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times associated with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position."
"management views the corporation’s financial strength as a competitive advantage."
"in general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or purchase products to/from other segments."

"the products bought and sold between segments can also be acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity and transportation capabilities."
"refer to note 18 for additional information on intersegment revenue."
"although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to global economic conditions, political events, decisions by opec and other major government resource owners and other factors, industry economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand."
"accordingly, the corporation evaluates the viability of its major investments over a range of prices."

" oil and natural gas reserves the estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, development and production costs, among other factors."
"the estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the corporation through long-standing approval guidelines."
"reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the global reserves and resources group which has significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management."
"notably, the corporation does not use specific quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation."
"key features of the reserve estimation process are covered in disclosure of reserves in item 2."
"oil and natural gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves."
" proved oil and natural gas reserves are determined in accordance with securities and exchange commission requirements."
"proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions and government regulations."
"proved reserves are determined using the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices during the reporting year."
" proved reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves."
"proved developed reserves include amounts which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods."
"proved undeveloped reserves include amounts expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion."
"proved undeveloped reserves are recognized only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that the reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances support a longer period of time."
" the percentage of proved developed reserves was 66 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2019, a decrease from 68 percent in 2018, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten years."
"although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policy, consumer preferences and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas prices."
" unproved reserves are quantities of oil and natural gas with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and include probable reserves."
"probable reserves are reserves that, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered."
"revisions in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields can occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of already available geologic, reservoir or production data, new geologic, reservoir or production data or changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves."
"revisions can also result from significant changes in development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity."
"unit-of-production depreciationoil and natural gas reserve quantities are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets."
"depreciation is calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves or proved developed reserves applied to actual production."
"the volumes produced and asset cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject to some variability."
"58management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used."
"the straight-line method may be used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves."
"for example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life."
"to the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent sec price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes."
"impairmentthe corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable."
" asset valuation analyses, profitability reviews and other periodic control processes assist the corporation in assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable."
"in general, the corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment."
"management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand."
"although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals."
"on the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining."
"this is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments and technology and efficiency advancements."
"opec investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies."
"the demand side is largely a function of general economic activities and levels of prosperity."
"because the lifespans of the vast majority of the corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the value of these assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices, and development and production costs."
"during the lifespan of these major assets, the corporation expects that oil and gas prices will experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses."
"in assessing whether the events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices."
"while near-term prices are subject to wide fluctuations, longer-term price views are more stable and meaningful for purposes of assessing future cash flows."
"when the industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in commodity prices, the market supply and demand conditions may result in changes to the corporation’s long-term price or margin assumptions it uses for its capital investment decisions."
"to the extent those changes result in a significant reduction to its long-term oil price, natural gas price or margin ranges, the corporation may consider that situation, in conjunction with other events or changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an indicator of potential impairment for certain assets."
" 59management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices."
"these prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the corporation’s long-term price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments."
"the corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves and therefore does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment."
"the corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year."
"this process is aligned with the requirements of asc 360 and relies in part on the corporation’s planning and budgeting cycle."
"if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts."
"in performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets."
"cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the corporation’s assumptions which are developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities."
"these evaluations make use of the corporation’s assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, and foreign currency exchange rates."
"volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales."
"management’s estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities."
"cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments."
"an asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset’s carrying value."
"impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value."
"fair value is based on market prices if an active market exists for the asset group, or discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk."
"significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the corporation expects to hold the properties."
"properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period."
"the corporation’s 2019 results include after-tax charges of $0."
"1 billion to reduce the carrying value of assets to fair value."
"the assessment of fair value requires the use of level 3 inputs and assumptions that are based upon the views of a likely market participant."
"the principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of both proved and unproved reserves, future commodity prices which were consistent with the average of third-party industry experts and government agencies, drilling and development costs, discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group, and comparable market transactions."
"factors which could put further assets at risk of impairment in the future include reductions in the corporation’s long-term price outlooks, changes in the allocation of capital, and operating cost increases which exceed the pace of efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural gas price increases."
"however, due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity prices, and the relationship between industry prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment charges related to the corporation’s long-lived assets."
" asset retirement obligations the corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets."
"the fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed."
"in the estimation of fair value, the corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation; technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates."
"asset retirement obligations are disclosed in note 9 to the financial statements."
" suspended exploratory well costs the corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project."
"exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense."
"the facts and circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end are disclosed in note 10 to the financial statements."
"60management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidations the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the corporation controls."
"they also include the corporation’s share of the undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses."
"amounts representing the corporation’s interest in entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting."
"investments in companies that are partially owned by the corporation are integral to the corporation’s operations."
"in some cases they serve to balance worldwide risks, and in others they provide the only available means of entry into a particular market or area of interest."
"the other parties, who also have an equity interest in these companies, are either independent third parties or host governments that share in the business results according to their ownership."
"the corporation does not invest in these companies in order to remove liabilities from its balance sheet."
"in fact, the corporation has long been on record supporting an alternative accounting method that would require each investor to consolidate its share of all assets and liabilities in these partially-owned companies rather than only its interest in net equity."
"this method of accounting for investments in partially-owned companies is not permitted by u."
"s."
"gaap except where the investments are in the direct ownership of a share of upstream assets and liabilities."
"however, for purposes of calculating return on average capital employed, which is not covered by u."

" pension benefits the corporation and its affiliates sponsor nearly 90 defined benefit plans in over 40 countries."
"the pension and other postretirement benefits footnote provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension expense."
"some of these plans provide pension benefits that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage advance funding."
"book reserves are established for these plans."
"the portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is expensed as services are rendered."
"the portion attributable to the increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid."
"the primary difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund assets."
"for funded plans, including those in the u."
"s."
", pension obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance arrangements."
"these plans are managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meet or exceed required funding levels as measured by relevant actuarial and government standards at the mandated measurement dates."
"in determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes."
"the corporation will continue to make contributions to these funded plans as necessary."
"all defined-benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength of the corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate."
"pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount rate for the benefit obligations and the long-term rate for future salary increases."
"pension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management."
"these assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook."

"the 10-year and 20-year actual returns on u."

"pension plan assets were 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively."
"the corporation establishes the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation."
"a single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class."
"a worldwide reduction of 0."
"5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $180 million before tax."
"differences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs."
"such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees."
" 61management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations litigation contingencies a variety of claims have been made against the corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits."
"management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies."
"the status of significant claims is summarized in note 16."
"the corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated."
"these amounts are not reduced by amounts that may be recovered under insurance or claims against third parties, but undiscounted receivables from insurers or other third parties may be accrued separately."
"the corporation revises such accruals in light of new information."
"for contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss."
"for purposes of our litigation contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other items which management believes should be disclosed."
"management judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict."
"however, the corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past."
"payments have not had a material adverse effect on operations or financial condition."
"in the corporation’s experience, large claims often do not result in large awards."
"large awards are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement."
" tax contingencies the corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world."
"significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict."
"the benefits of uncertain tax positions that the corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities."
"for a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized."
"a reserve is established for the difference between a position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statements."
"the corporation’s unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in note 19."

"because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."

"the impact of proved oil and natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant and equipment, netas described in notes 1, 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the corporation’s consolidated upstream property, plant and equipment balance, net was $197 billion as of december 31, 2019, and the related depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 was $15 billion."
"management uses the successful efforts method to account for its exploration and production activities."
"costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property are capitalized when incurred."
"as disclosed by management, proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets."
"the estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserves is an ongoing process based on technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, development and production costs, among other factors."
"reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the global reserves and resources group ."
"the principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved oil and natural gas reserves on upstream pp&e, net is a critical audit matter is that there was significant judgment by management, including the use of management’s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves."
"this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating evidence obtained related to the significant assumptions used by management, including development costs and production volumes."
"65report of independent registered public accounting firm addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements."
"these procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the calculation of dd&a expense."
"these procedures also included, among others testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in developing management’s estimates, evaluating the methods and significant assumptions used by management in developing these estimates, including development costs and production volumes, and testing the unit-of-production rates used to calculate dd&a expense."
"evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves also involved obtaining evidence to support the reasonableness of the assumptions, including whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the past performance of the company, and whether they were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit."
"the work of management’s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves."
"as a basis for using this work, the specialists’ qualifications and objectivity were understood, as well as the methods and assumptions used by the specialists."
"the procedures performed also included tests of data used by management’s specialists, and an evaluation of the specialists’ findings."

"generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities."

"summary of accounting policies principles of consolidation and accounting for investmentsthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the corporation controls."
"they also include the corporation’s share of the undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses."
"amounts representing the corporation’s interest in entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in “investments, advances and long-term receivables”."
"the corporation’s share of the net income of these companies is included in the consolidated statement of income caption “income from equity affiliates”."
"majority ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which subsidiaries are consolidated."
"however, certain factors may indicate that a majority-owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted for using the equity method of accounting."
"these factors occur where the minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract substantive participating rights."
"these include the right to approve operating policies, expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and management compensation and succession plans."
"evidence of loss in value that might indicate impairment of investments in companies accounted for on the equity method is assessed to determine if such evidence represents a loss in value that is other than temporary."
"examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses, negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s business segment or geographic region."
"if evidence of an other than temporary loss in fair value below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is recognized."
"in the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash flows are used to assess fair value."
"investments in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income."
"the corporation uses the modified approach for equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value."
"this modified approach measures investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions in a similar investment of the same issuer."
"the corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment for equity method investments is reported in “accumulated other comprehensive income”."
"revenue recognitionthe corporation generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical products under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices."
"in some cases, products may be sold under long-term agreements, with periodic price adjustments to reflect market conditions."
"revenue is recognized at the amount the corporation expects to receive when the customer has taken control, which is typically when title transfers and the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership."
"the prices of certain sales are based on price indices that are sometimes not available until the next period."
"in such cases, estimated realizations are accrued when the sale is recognized, and are finalized when the price is available."
"such adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods are not significant."
"payment for revenue transactions is typically due within 30 days."
"future volume delivery obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the period are expected to be fulfilled through ordinary production or purchases."
"these performance obligations are based on market prices at the time of the transaction and are fully constrained due to market price volatility."
"purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined and recorded as exchanges measured at the book value of the item sold."
"“sales and other operating revenue” and “notes and accounts receivable” primarily arise from contracts with customers."
"long-term receivables are primarily from non-customers."
"contract assets are mainly from marketing assistance programs and are not significant."
"contract liabilities are mainly customer prepayments and accruals of expected volume discounts and are not significant."
" 72notes to consolidated financial statements  income and other taxesthe corporation excludes from the consolidated statement of income certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities."

"derivative instrumentsthe corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that arise from existing assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions."
"all derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value."
"derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met."
"collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively."
"recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative."
"all gains and losses from derivative instruments for which the corporation does not apply hedge accounting are immediately recognized in earnings."
"we may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges."
"for fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings."
"for cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings."
"fair valuefair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants."
"hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value."
"hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities."
"hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability."
"hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market."
"inventoriescrude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost ."
"inventory costs include expenditures and other charges directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location."
"selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost."
"inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less."
"property, plant and equipmentcost basis."
"the corporation uses the “successful efforts” method to account for its exploration and production activities."
"under this method, costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis."
"costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property are capitalized when incurred."
"exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and where the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project."
"exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense."
"other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred."
"development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized."
"depreciation, depletion and amortization."
"depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration."
"acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas reserves."
"capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods."
"under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank."
"in the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used."
"the straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves."
"for example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life."
"investments in refinery, chemical process, and lubes basestock manufacturing equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 25-year life."
"service station buildings and fixed improvements generally are depreciated over a 20-year life."
"maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred."
"major renewals and improvements are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired."
" impairment assessment."
"the corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable."
" asset valuation analysis, profitability reviews and other periodic control processes assist the corporation in assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable."
"in general, the corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment."
"management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand."
"although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals."
"on the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining."
"this is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments and technology and efficiency advancements."
"opec investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies."
"the demand side is largely a function of general economic activities and levels of prosperity."
"because the lifespans of the vast majority of the corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the value of these assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices and development and production costs."
"during the lifespan of these major assets, the corporation expects that oil and gas prices will experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses."
"in assessing whether the events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices."
"while near-term prices are subject to wide fluctuations, longer-term price views are more stable and meaningful for purposes of assessing future cash flows."
"when the industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in commodity prices, the market supply and demand conditions may result in changes to the corporation’s long-term price or margin assumptions it uses for its capital investment decisions."
"to the extent those changes result in a significant reduction to its long-term oil price, natural gas price or margin ranges, the corporation may consider that situation, in conjunction with other events or changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an indicator of potential impairment for certain assets."
"in the upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices."
"these prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the corporation’s long-term price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments."
"the corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves and therefore does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment."
" 74notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year."
"this process is aligned with the requirements of asc 360 and relies in part on the corporation’s planning and budgeting cycle."
"if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts."
"in performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets."
"cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the corporation’s assumptions which are developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities."
"these evaluations make use of the corporation’s assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, and foreign currency exchange rates."
"volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales."
"management’s estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities."
"cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments."
"an asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset’s carrying value."
"impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value."
"fair value is based on market prices if an active market exists for the asset group, or discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk."
"significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the corporation expects to hold the properties."
"properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period."
" other."
"gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty about the recovery of costs applicable to any interest retained nor any substantial obligation for future performance by the corporation."
"losses on properties sold are recognized when incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than the carrying value."
"interest costs incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase of multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets."
"the project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use."
"capitalized interest costs are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets."
" asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilitiesthe corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets."
"the fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed."
"the costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated."
"over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value."
"liabilities for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated."
"these liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash expenditures are not discounted."
" foreign currency translationthe corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates."
"downstream and chemical operations primarily use the local currency."

"oil sands mining operations are included in the results of operations in accordance with securities and exchange commission and financial accounting standards board rules."

"costs incurred also include new asset retirement obligations established in the current year, as well as increases or decreases to the asset retirement obligation resulting from changes in cost estimates or abandonment date."
"total consolidated costs incurred in 2019 were $19,240 million, up $2,912 million from 2018, due primarily to higher development costs, partially offset by lower acquisition costs of unproved properties."
"in 2018 costs were $16,328 million, down $3,316 million from 2017, due primarily to lower acquisition costs of unproved properties, partially offset by higher development costs."
"total equity company costs incurred in 2019 were $2,916 million, down $115 million from 2018, due primarily to lower development costs."
"the definitions used are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission’s rule 4-10 of regulation s-x."
"proved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain."
"in some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves."
"in accordance with the securities and exchange commission’s rules, the corporation’s year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period."
"these reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows."
"revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of already available geologic, reservoir or production data, new geologic, reservoir or production data or changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves."
"revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity."
"reserve volumes that were subject to a downward revision can be revised upward at some point in the future when price levels increase, costs decline, and / or operating efficiencies occur."
"proved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate’s participation in proved reserves and exxonmobil’s ownership percentage of the proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others."
"natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants."
"these liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids."
"in the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately."
"however, the corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies."
"reserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement."
"the production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes."
"as oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices."
"when prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs."
"the percentage of total liquids and natural gas proved reserves at year-end 2019 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 10 percent of liquids, 12 percent of natural gas and 10 percent on an oil-equivalent basis ."
"net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well."
"net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion."
"crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from exxonmobil’s oil and natural gas reserves."
"the natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the operating information due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes."
"the changes between 2019 year-end proved reserves and 2018 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1."
"5 billion oil-equivalent barrels, a reduction of 0."

"in 2018, the dutch cabinet notified parliament of its intention to further reduce previously legislated groningen gas extraction in response to seismic events over the last several years."

"the standardized measure includes costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations."
"the corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the corporation’s expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves."
"the standardized measure is prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including first-day-of-the-month average prices, which represent discrete points in time and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year as prices change."
