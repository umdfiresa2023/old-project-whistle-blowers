"2%Technology innovation has been a hallmark of PPG’s success throughout its history."
"The Company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth."
" We align our product development with the macro trends in the markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs."
" Additionally, we operate laboratories in close geographic proximity to our customers, and we customize our products for our customers' end-use applications."
"Our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management."
"We have obtained government funding for a small portion of the Company’s research efforts, and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate."
"We own and operate several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes."
"In addition to the Company’s centralized principal research and development centers, operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence."
"As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively, we operate global competitive sourcing laboratories."
"Because of our broad array of products and customers, we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform."
"Raw Materials, Energy and LogisticsThe effective management of raw materials, energy and logistics is important to PPG’s continued success as PPG uses a wide variety of complex raw materials that serve as the building blocks of our manufactured products."
"The Company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins, titanium dioxide and other pigments, and solvents in the coatings businesses and sand and soda ash in the specialty coatings and materials business."
"Raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide."
"These raw materials represent PPG’s single largest production cost component."
"Most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet our planned operating requirements for the future."
"Supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts with multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible."
"Our raw materials include bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy."
"While prices for certain raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices and global supply and demand changes, such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil and natural gas inputs."
"We are continuing our aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials."
"These initiatives include qualifying multiple sources of supply, both local and international, including suppliers from Asia and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations and reducing the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations."
"We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes."
"Our ongoing, global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards."
"Changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the European Union and many other countries, including China, Canada, the United States, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea."
" Because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized, the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time."
" We anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally, and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations."
"PPG has joined a global initiative to eliminate child labor from the mica industry, and the Company is continuing to take steps, including audits of our suppliers, to ensure compliance with PPG’s policy against the use of child labor in our supply chains."
"We typically experience fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, government regulation, and global supply and demand factors."
"For 2019 versus 2018, we experienced a deflationary movement in costs, particularly in the second half of 2019, driven by a general slowdown in industrial demand affecting the global supply and demand balance in several of our key purchasing categories."
"This was in addition to pricing decreases in most of our key feedstocks throughout 2019."
"In contrast, average raw material costs rose by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2018 versus 2017 due to the rise in feedstock prices, acute shortages in key raw materials and the impact of Chinese environmental regulations."
"Given the continuing volatility in certain energy-based input costs, particularly the volatility in oil and oil-based derivatives, and foreign currencies, we are not able to predict with certainty the 2020 full-year impact of changes in raw material pricing 10 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-Kversus 2019."
"Further, given the distribution nature of many of our businesses, logistics and distribution costs are sizable, as are wage and benefit changes."
"For 2019 versus 2018, we experienced a slight decrease in our logistics costs as a percentage of sales driven by operational efficiency improvements and through sourcing efforts to take advantage of the reduction in industry surface transportation shipping rates due to an improvement in the availability of transportation assets."
"We expect these costs to remain steady or be slightly lower through 2020 given the continuing efforts by PPG to improve our global operational efficiencies."
"BacklogIn general, PPG does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders."
"Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders."
"Global OperationsPPG has a significant investment in non-U."
"S."
"operations."
"This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region on our total Net sales and Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income."
"As a result of our expansion outside the U."
"S."
", we are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets, trade protection measures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates."
"During 2019, unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased Net sales by approximately $400 million and Income before income taxes by approximately $50 million."
"Seasonality PPG’s Income before income taxes has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and Cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to end-use market seasonality, primarily in our architectural coatings businesses."
"Demand for our architectural coatings products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement, maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the U."
"S."
", Canada and Europe."
"The Latin America paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter."
"These cyclical activity levels result in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher Cash from operating activities."
"Employee RelationsThe average number of people employed worldwide by PPG during 2019 was approximately 47,600."
"The Company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world."
"We observe local customs, laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements."
"There were no significant work stoppages in 2019."
"While we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future, we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms."
"To date, these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on our results of operations."
"Overall, we believe we have good relationships with our employees."
"Environmental MattersPPG is committed to operating in a sustainable manner and to helping our customers meet their sustainability goals."
"Our sustainability efforts are led by the Technology and Environment Committee of our Board of Directors and our Sustainability Committee, which is comprised of members of PPG’s senior management team."
"The Sustainability Committee establishes policies, programs, procedures and goals to address sustainability in our business practices, including resource management, climate change, innovation, communications, purchasing, manufacturing and employee wellness."
"Our dedication to innovation is intertwined with sustainability."
"Once again, we increased the percent of our sales from sustainable products to 33% in 2019 from 32% in 2018."
"We are marketing an ever-growing variety of products and services that provide environmental, safety and other benefits to our customers."
"Our products contribute to lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles, airplanes and ships, and they help our customers reduce their energy consumption, conserve water and reduce waste."
"These products include a compact automotive paint process that saves energy and reduces water usage; sustainable, 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 11waterborne coatings formulations; lightweight sealants and coatings for aircraft; coatings that cool surfaces; coatings for recyclable metal packaging; and solutions for autonomous and battery-powered vehicles."
"The Company’s commitment to sustainability continues to yield tangible results."
"In 2019, we again made significant progress reducing our energy intensity, greenhouse gas emissions intensity and waste intensity."
"More information about PPG’s sustainability values, efforts, goals and data and our community and employee engagement programs can be found in our Sustainability Report and on our sustainability website at http://sustainability."

"We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment."
"In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned, relative to environmental matters, within the industries in which it operates."
"PPG is negotiating with various government agencies concerning current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations, including certain sites on the National Priority List."
"While PPG is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations, each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability."
"Generally, however, a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site."
"There is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites, due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation."
"The Company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated."
"Our experience to date regarding environmental matters leads us to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites."
"Management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time."
"In addition to the $304 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately $100 million to $200 million."
"These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually significant."
"The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them."
"2019 2018 2017Capital expenditures for environmental control projects$15 $20 $7It is expected that capital expenditures for such projects in 2020 will be in the range of $20 million to $30 million."
"Although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies, it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase."
"Management believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized."
"See Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs."

"Risk FactorsAs a global manufacturer of paints, coatings and specialty materials, we operate in a business environment that includes risks."
"These risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors."
"Each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity."
"While the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties."
"Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations, financial position and liquidity."
"12 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-KIncreases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results."
"Our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials."
"Raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide."
"These raw materials represent PPG’s single largest production cost component."
"While not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world."
"In most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower."
"Most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future."
"Adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible."
"The Company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials."
"These initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from Asia and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations, and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations."
"Our raw materials include bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy."
"An inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products."
"Increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our Income from continuing operations or Cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner."
"The pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows."
"Demand for our products and services depends, in part, on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business."
"Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future."
"Recently, global economic uncertainty has increased due to a number of factors, including slowing global growth, consumer sentiment and commodity market volatility, disruption in existing trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs, the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union and weaker demand in China."
"PPG provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies."
"This broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced Income from continuing operations and Cash from operating activities."
"We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment."
"Environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances."
"In addition, various laws regulate health and safety matters."
"The environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances."
"Violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties."
"Future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
"We are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought."
"PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought."
"Those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment, securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of PPG’s current and past business activities."
"Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources."
"We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses."
"We believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including those described in Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized."
"Nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, Cash from operating activities or financial condition."
"2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 13Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results."
"We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U."
"S."

"Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U."

"dollar against other currencies will affect our Net sales, Net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies."
"We may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions."
"However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening or weakening of the U."

"laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U."
"S."
" and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery."
"We are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as interpretations by courts and regulators."
"These laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs."
"For example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve."
"Developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets."
"Import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains."
"Further, although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or businesses that we acquire."
"Any non-compliance or such improper actions or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees."
"Our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results."
"PPG has a significant investment in global operations."
"This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region."
"Notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries."
"As a result of our operations outside the U."
"S."
", we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection."
"Our percentage of sales generated in 2019 by products sold outside the U."
"S."
"was approximately 61%."
"Changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate."
"As a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the U."
"S."
"and non-U."
"S."
"jurisdictions."
"Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes."
" Our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation."
"Further, PPG may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it becomes available."
"Recent developments, including the European Commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities."
"If our effective income tax rate was to increase, our Cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected."
"Although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals."
"If future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our Cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations."
"14 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-KBusiness disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition."
"Unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, significant public health issues, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of PPG, our customers and our suppliers."
"It is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events."
"However, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers."
"Integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations."
"Part of the Company’s strategy is growth through acquisitions."
"Over the last decade, we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future."
"These risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, Cash from operating activities or financial condition."
"Our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results."
"Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products."
"To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers."
"This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs."
" We believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years."
" Vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings."
" In addition, through the introduction of new technologies, new business models or new methods of travel, such as ridesharing, the number of automotive OEM new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive OEM coatings and related automotive parts."
"Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products."
"If we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected."
"The industries in which we operate are highly competitive."
"With each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products."
"Additionally, our ability to achieve price increases may impact the overall economics for the products we offer."
"Competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations."
"The security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate."
" Increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data."
"Despite our efforts 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 15to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches."
"This could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations."
"In 2018, we concluded that previously issued financial statements as detailed below should not be relied upon and restated those previously issued financial statements, which led to, among other things, shareholder litigation, investigations by the SEC and the U."
"S."
"Attorney’s office, a settlement by the Company with the SEC and unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees, and which may result in certain other risks."
"As discussed in the Explanatory Note, Note 2, “Restatement of Previously Reported Consolidated Annual Financial Statements” and in Note 19, “Quarterly Financial Information ” under Item 8 of the 2017 Form 10-K/A, in 2018 we concluded that our previously issued financial statements as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2017, and the final quarterly and year-to-date period in 2016, should no longer be relied upon."
"The determination that the applicable financial statements should no longer be relied upon and that these financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of misstatements."
"Although the Company restated these financial statements, remediated the material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, reached a settlement with the SEC and is no longer the subject of an investigation by the U."

"From the late 1880’s until the early 1970’s, PPG owned property located in Cadogan and North Buffalo Townships, Pennsylvania which was used for the disposal of solid waste from PPG’s former glass manufacturing facility in Ford City, Pennsylvania."
"In October 2018, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection approved PPG’s cleanup plan for the Cadogan Property."
"In April 2019, PPG and the DEP entered into a consent order and agreement which incorporated PPG’s approved cleanup plan and a draft final permit for the collection and discharge of seeps emanating from the former disposal area."
"The CO&A includes a civil penalty of $1."

"2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 29Contractual obligationsWe continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments, cash from operations and the Company’s access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPG’s significant contractual obligations."
"These significant contractual obligations are presented in the following table."
"Includes interest payments."
"Includes the high end of the range of the expected non-US mandatory pension contributions for 2020 only, as PPG is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2020."
"The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice."
"Other liquidity mattersAt December 31, 2019, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was $177 million."
"The timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities."
"PPG does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year."
"The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur."
"Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements include unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 9, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K."
"Critical Accounting EstimatesManagement has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate."
"ContingenciesContingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss."
"The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years."
"For more information on these matters, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” and Note 12, “Income Taxes” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K."
"30 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-KDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit PlansAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works."
"To accomplish this, we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates."
"The Company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually."
"See Note 13, “Employee Benefit Plans” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on these plans and the assumptions used."
"Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, the Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition."
"The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized as goodwill."
"The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results."
"The business and technical judgment of management was used in determining which intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets."
"Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test at least annually, or more frequently if an indication of impairment arises."
"The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount."
"In the quantitative test, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model."
"Key assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model include discount rates, tax rates, future revenues, operating cash flows and capital expenditures."
"For more information on these matters, see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K."
"We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates."

"Foreign Currency RiskWe conduct operations in many countries around the world."
"Our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk."
"Certain foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2019 and 2018 were designated as a hedge of PPG’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk."
"As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $7 million and a net asset of $36 million, respectively."
"The potential reduction in PPG’s Income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European and Canadian currencies and 20% for Asian and Latin American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 would have been $357 million and $291 million, respectively."

"Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its interest rate risk of fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs."
"In the first quarter of 2018, PPG entered into interest rate swaps which converted $525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt."
"The fair value of these contracts was an asset of $35 million and $8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively."
"An increase in variable interest rates of 10% would lower the fair value of these swaps and increase interest 32 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-Kexpense by $7 million and $10 million for the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively."

"Quantitative goodwill impairment testing is performed during the fourth quarter of each year by comparing the estimated fair value of an associated reporting unit as of September 30 to its carrying value."
"Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model."
"Key assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model include projected future revenues, discount rates, operating cash flows, capital expenditures and tax rates."
"In 2019, the annual impairment testing review of goodwill did not result in impairment of the Company’s reporting units."
"The Company has determined that certain acquired trademarks have indefinite useful lives."
"The Company tests the carrying value of these trademarks for impairment at least annually, or as needed whenever events and circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable."
"The annual assessment takes place in the fourth quarter of each year either by completing a qualitative assessment or quantitatively by comparing the estimated fair value of each trademark as of September 30 to its carrying value."
"Fair value is estimated by using the relief from royalty method ."
"The qualitative assessment includes consideration of factors, including revenue relative to the asset being assessed, the operating results of the related business as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount."
"In 2019, the annual impairment testing review of indefinite-lived intangibles did not result in an impairment."
"Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable."
"Receivables and Allowances All trade receivables are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at the outstanding principal adjusted for any allowance for credit losses and any charge offs."
"The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce receivables to their estimated net realizable value when it is probable that a loss will be incurred."
"Those estimates are based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions, a review of the aging of accounts receivable and the assessments of current creditworthiness of customers."
"LeasesThe Company determines if a contract is a lease at the inception of the arrangement."
"The Company reviews all options to extend, terminate, or purchase its right of use assets at the inception of the lease and accounts for these options when they are reasonably certain of being exercised."
"Certain real estate leases contain lease and non-lease components, which are 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 43Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsaccounted for separately."
"For certain equipment leases, lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component."
"Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet."
"Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term."
"Variable lease expense is based on contractual arrangements with PPG’s lessors determined based on external indices or other relevant market factors."
"In addition, PPG’s variable lease expense also includes elements of a contract that do not represent a good or service but for which the lessee is responsible for paying."
"Nearly all of PPG’s lease contracts do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate."
"For these contracts, PPG’s estimated incremental borrowing rate is based on information available at the inception of the lease."
"Product warrantiesThe Company accrues for product warranties at the time the associated products are sold based on historical claims experience."
"The reserve, pretax charges against income and cash outlays for product warranties were not significant to the consolidated financial statements of the Company for any year presented."
"Asset Retirement ObligationsAn asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of that long-lived asset."
"PPG recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made."
"The asset retirement obligation is subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value."
"The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful life."
"PPG’s asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the retirement or closure of certain assets used in PPG’s manufacturing process."
"The accrued asset retirement obligation is recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, and was $21 million and $22 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively."
"PPG’s only conditional asset retirement obligation relates to the possible future abatement of asbestos contained in certain PPG production facilities."
"The asbestos in PPG’s production facilities arises from the application of normal and customary building practices in the past when the facilities were constructed."
"This asbestos is encapsulated in place and, as a result, there is no current legal requirement to abate it."
"Because there is no requirement to abate, the Company does not have any current plans or an intention to abate and therefore the timing, method and cost of future abatement, if any, are not known."
"The Company has not recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with asbestos abatement, given the uncertainty concerning the timing of future abatement, if any."

"The fair values of these financial instruments approximated their carrying values at December 31, 2019 and 2018, in the aggregate, except for long-term debt instruments."
"Hedging ActivitiesThe Company has exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates."
"As a result, financial instruments, including derivatives, have been used to hedge a portion of these underlying economic exposures."
"Certain of these instruments qualify as fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges upon meeting the requisite criteria, including effectiveness of offsetting hedged or underlying exposures."
"Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in Income before income taxes in the period incurred."

"When outstanding, the interest rate swaps are typically designated as fair value hedges of certain outstanding debt obligations of the Company and are recorded at fair value."
"In February 2018, PPG entered into interest rate swaps which converted $525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt."
"The swaps are designated as fair value hedges and are carried at fair value."

"As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were cash equivalents, equity securities and derivatives."
"In addition, the Company measures its pension plan assets at fair value ."
"The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the following three levels: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date."
"Level 1 inputs are considered to be the most reliable evidence of fair value as they are based on unadjusted quoted market prices from various financial information service providers and securities exchanges."
"Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable prices that are not quoted on active exchanges, which include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means."
"The fair values of the derivative instruments reflect the instruments’ contractual terms, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including forward curves."
"Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs employed for measuring the fair value of assets or liabilities."
"The Company does not have any recurring financial assets or liabilities that are recorded in its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 that are classified as Level 3 inputs."
"Excluding capital lease obligations of $12 million and short term borrowings of $4 million as of December 31, 2018."
"The fair values of the debt instruments were based on discounted cash flows and interest rates then currently available to the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities and were measured using level 2 inputs."
"Call and put option on noncontrolling interestIn December 2019, PPG paid cash to acquire the remaining noncontrolling interest in a coatings business, of which PPG previously had a majority interest."
"Prior to this transaction, the minority shareholder’s results were included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statement of income."
"Historically, PPG recorded the noncontrolling interest in this consolidated affiliate as a liability instead of equity on its consolidated balance sheets due to call and put option provisions associated with the noncontrolling interest, which had similar terms."
"As a result of the December 2019 transaction, this liability is no longer outstanding as of December 31, 2019."
"As of December 31, 2018, the liability was $40 million."

"The Company has the right to modify, amend or terminate certain of these benefit plans in the future."
"Effective January 1, 2017, the Company-sponsored Medicare-eligible plans were replaced by a Medicare private exchange."
"The announcement of this plan design change triggered a remeasurement of PPG’s retiree medical benefit obligation using prevailing interest rates."
"The plan design change resulted in a $306 million reduction in the Company's postretirement benefit obligation."
"PPG accounted for the plan design change prospectively, and the impact will be amortized to periodic postretirement benefit cost over a 5."
"6 year period through 2022."
"The accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, but does not include the effects of estimated future pay increases."
"The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $3."
"4 billion and $2."
"9 billion, respectively."
"The accumulated net actuarial losses exceeded 10% of the higher of the market value of plan assets or the PBO at the beginning of each of the last three years; therefore, amortization of such excess has been included in net periodic benefit costs for pension and other postretirement benefits in these periods."
"The amortization period is the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits unless a plan is mostly inactive in which case the amortization period is the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants."
"Accumulated prior service cost is amortized over the future service periods of those employees who are active at the dates of the plan amendments and who are expected to receive benefits."
"Except for Pension settlement charges in 2017, all other components of net periodic benefit cost are recorded in Other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of income."

"The Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost for countries with significant pension plans."
"The full yield curve approach allows the Company to align the applicable discount rates with the cost of additional service being earned and the interest being accrued on these obligations."
"A change in the discount rate of 100 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact 2020 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by $16 million and $6 million, respectively."

"Pittsburgh Corning Corporation asbestos bankruptcyIn 2000, PC filed for Chapter 11 in the U."
"S."
"Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in an effort to permanently and comprehensively resolve all of its pending and future asbestos-related liability claims."
"The Bankruptcy Court subsequently entered a series of orders preliminarily enjoining the prosecution of asbestos litigation against PPG until after the effective date of a confirmed PC plan of reorganization."
"During the pendency of this preliminary injunction staying asbestos litigation against PPG, PPG and certain of its historical liability insurers negotiated a settlement with representatives of present and future asbestos claimants."
"That settlement was incorporated into a PC plan of reorganization that was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on May 24, 2013 and ultimately became effective on April 27, 2016."
"With the effectiveness of the plan, the preliminary injunction staying the prosecution of asbestos litigation against PPG expired by its own terms on May 27, 2016."
"In accordance with the settlement, the Bankruptcy Court issued a permanent channeling injunction under Section 524 of the Bankruptcy Code that prohibits present and future claimants from asserting claims against PPG that arise, in whole or in part, out of exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products manufactured, sold and/or distributed by PC or asbestos on or emanating from any PC premises."
"The channeling injunction, by its terms, also prohibits codefendants in cases that are subject to the channeling injunction from asserting claims against PPG for contribution, indemnification or other recovery."
"The foregoing PC related claims are referred to as “PC Relationship Claims."
"”The Bankruptcy Court’s channeling injunction channels the Company’s liability for PC Relationship Claims to a trust funded in part by PPG and its participating insurers for the benefit of current and future PC asbestos claimants ."
"The Trust is the sole recourse for holders of PC Relationship Claims."
"PPG and its affiliates have no further liability or responsibility for, and are permanently protected from, pending and future PC Relationship Claims."
"The channeling injunction does not extend to present and future claims against PPG that arise out of alleged exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products historically manufactured, sold and/or distributed by PPG or its subsidiaries or for which they are alleged to be liable that are not PC Relationship Claims, and does not extend to claims against PPG alleging personal injury allegedly caused by asbestos on premises presently or formerly owned, leased or occupied by PPG."
"These claims are referred to as “non-PC Relationship Claims."
"As a result of the foregoing, the Company does not consider these three categories of claims to be open or active litigation against it, although the Company cannot now determine whether, or the extent to which, any of these claims may in the future be reinstituted, reinstated, or revived such that they may become open and active non-PC Relationship Claims against it."
"Current open and active claims post-Pittsburgh Corning bankruptcyAs of December 31, 2019, the Company was aware of approximately 605 open and active asbestos-related claims pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries."
"These claims consist of non-PC Relationship Claims against PPG and claims against a PPG subsidiary the Company acquired on April 1, 2013."
"The Company is defending these open and active claims vigorously."
"PPG has established reserves totaling approximately $190 million for asbestos-related claims that would not be channeled to the Trust which, based on presently available information, we believe will be sufficient to encompass all of PPG’s current and estimable potential future asbestos liabilities."
" These reserves, which are included within Other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, represent PPG’s best estimate of its liability for these claims."
"These reserves include a $162 million reserve established in 2009 in connection with an amendment to the PC plan of reorganization for non-PC Relationship Claims other than claims arising from premises-related exposures."
"PPG does not have sufficient current claim information or settlement history on which to base a better estimate of this liability in light of the fact that the Bankruptcy Court’s injunction staying most asbestos claims against the Company was in effect from April 2000 through May 2016."
"These reserves also include PPG’s best estimate, following an analysis performed in 2019 of its claims history and discussions with consultants and its counsel, of the value of the Company’s potential liability for premises-related non-PC Relationship Claims against it and claims against PPG’s subsidiary acquired on April 1, 2013 that are presently pending, and that are projected to be asserted through December 31, 2028."
"In the fourth quarter of 2019, PPG increased the reserve related to these matters and recognized a charge of approximately $10 million included in Other charges in the consolidated statement of income."
"PPG monitors the activity associated with its asbestos claims and evaluates, on a periodic basis, its estimated liability for such claims, its insurance assets then available, and all underlying assumptions to determine whether any adjustment to the reserves for these claims is required."
"All of these factors may have a material effect upon future asbestos-related liability estimates."
"As a potential offset to any future asbestos financial exposure, under the PC plan of reorganization 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 69Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsPPG retained, for its own account, the right to pursue insurance coverage from certain of its historical insurers that did not participate in the PC plan of reorganization."
"While the ultimate outcome of PPG’s asbestos litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, PPG believes that any financial exposure resulting from its asbestos-related claims will not have a material adverse effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations."
"Environmental MattersIt is PPG’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated."
"Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted."
"In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized."
"Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time."
"As remediation at certain legacy environmental sites progresses, PPG continues to refine its assumptions underlying the estimates of the expected future costs of its remediation programs."
"PPG’s ongoing evaluation may result in additional charges against income to increase the reserves for these sites."
"Remediation activities at our legacy sites are not related to the ongoing operations of PPG."
"In 2019, 2018 and 2017, certain charges have been recorded based on updated estimates to increase existing reserves for these sites."
"Certain other charges related to environmental remediation actions are also expensed as incurred."
"As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies associated with PPG’s former chromium manufacturing plant in Jersey City, New Jersey, glass and chemical manufacturing sites, and for other environmental contingencies, including current manufacturing locations and National Priority List sites."
"These reserves are reported as Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet."

"During the past three years, charges for estimated environmental remediation costs were significantly higher than PPG’s historical range."
"Excluding the charges related to New Jersey Chrome, pretax charges against income for environmental remediation have ranged between approximately $5 million and $35 million per year for the past 10 years."
"Management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to range from $80 million to $100 million in 2020 and $20 million to $50 million annually from 2021 through 2024."
"It is possible that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter the Company’s expectations with respect to future charges against income and future cash outlays."
"Specifically, the level of expected future remediation costs and cash outlays is highly dependent upon activity related to New Jersey Chrome as discussed below."
"70 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-KNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsRemediation: New Jersey ChromeIn June 2009, PPG entered into a settlement agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Jersey City, New Jersey which was in the form of a Judicial Consent Order ."
"Under the JCO, PPG accepted sole responsibility for the remediation activities at its former chromium manufacturing location in Jersey City and 19 additional sites."
"The principal contaminant of concern is hexavalent chromium."
"The JCO also provided for the appointment of a court-approved Site Administrator who is responsible for establishing a master schedule for the remediation of the 20 PPG sites which existed at that time."
"One site was subsequently removed from the JCO process during 2014 and will be remediated separately at a future date."
"A total of 19 sites remain subject to the JCO process."
"The most significant assumptions underlying the estimate of remediation costs for all New Jersey Chrome sites are those related to the extent and concentration of chromium impacts in the soil, as these determine the quantity of soil that must be treated in place, the quantity that will have to be excavated and transported for offsite disposal, and the nature of disposal required."
"PPG regularly evaluates the assessments of costs incurred to date versus current progress and the potential cost impacts of the most recent information, including the extent of impacted soils, percentage of hazardous versus non-hazardous soils, daily soil excavation rates, and engineering, administrative and other associated costs."
"Based on these assessments, the reserve is adjusted accordingly."
"Principal factors affecting costs include refinements in the estimate of the mix of hazardous to non-hazardous soils to be excavated, an overall increase in soil volumes to be excavated, enhanced water management requirements, decreased daily soil excavation rates due to site conditions, initial estimates for remedial actions related to groundwater, and oversight and management costs."
"The reserve adjustments for the estimated costs to remediate all New Jersey Chrome sites are exclusive of any third party indemnification, as the recovery of any such amounts is uncertain."
"Groundwater remediation at the former Garfield Avenue chromium-manufacturing site and five adjacent sites is expected to occur over several years after NJDEP’s approval of the work plan."
"Ongoing groundwater monitoring will be utilized to develop a final groundwater remedial action work plan which is currently expected to be submitted to NJDEP in 2021."
"PPG’s financial reserve for remediation of all New Jersey Chrome sites is $134 million at December 31, 2019."
"The major cost components of this liability continue to be related to excavation, transportation and disposal of impacted soil, as well as construction services."
"These components each account for approximately 20%, 14% and 28% of the accrued amount, respectively."
"There are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals."
"Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the New Jersey Chrome sites."
"Further resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years."
"As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will continue to be adjusted."
"Remediation: Glass, Chemicals and Other SitesAmong other sites at which PPG is managing environmental liabilities, remedial actions are occurring at a chemical manufacturing site in Barberton, Ohio, where PPG has completed a Facility Investigation and Corrective Measure Study under the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action Program."
"PPG has also been addressing the impacts from a legacy plate glass manufacturing site in Kokomo, Indiana under the Voluntary Remediation Program of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and a site associated with a legacy plate glass manufacturing site near Ford City, Pennsylvania under the Pennsylvania Land Recycling Program under the oversight of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection."
"PPG is currently performing additional investigation and remedial activities at these locations."
"With respect to certain other waste sites, the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties also contributes to the uncertainty of estimating PPG’s final costs."
"Although contributors of waste to sites involving other potentially responsible parties may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability, in general, final allocations of costs are made based on the relative contributions of wastes to such sites."
"PPG is generally not a major contributor to such sites."
"2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 71Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsRemediation: Reasonably Possible MattersIn addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $100 million to $200 million."
"Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence."
"These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually significant."
"The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them."
"The impact of evolving programs, such as natural resource damage claims, industrial site re-use initiatives and domestic and international remediation programs, also adds to the present uncertainties with regard to the ultimate resolution of this unreserved exposure to future loss."
"The Company’s assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments."

"Performance-based RSUs vest based on achieving specific annual performance targets for earnings per share growth and cash flow return on capital over the three calendar year-end periods following the date of grant."
"Unless forfeited, the performance-based RSUs will be paid out in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both at the Company’s discretion at the end of the three-year performance period if PPG meets the performance targets."
"The amount paid for performance-based awards may range from 0% to 180% of the original grant, based upon the frequency with which the annual earnings per share growth and cash flow return on capital performance targets are met over the three calendar year periods comprising the vesting period."
"PPG has assumed that performance-based RSUs granted in 2017, 2018 and 2019 will vest at the 100% level."
"As of December 31, 2019, three of the six possible performance targets had been met for the 2017 grant, two of the four possible performance targets had been met for the 2018 grant, and one of two possible performance targets had been met for the 2019 grant."

"Contingent Share Grants The Company also provides grants of contingent shares to selected key executives that may be earned based on PPG total shareholder return over the three-year period following the date of grant."
"Contingent share grants are made annually and are paid out at the end of each three-year period based on the Company’s performance."
"Performance is measured by determining the percentile rank of the total shareholder return of PPG common stock in relation to the total shareholder return of the S&P 500 for the three-year period following the date of grant."
"This comparison group represents the entire S&P 500 Index as it existed at the beginning of the performance period, excluding any companies that have been removed from the index because they ceased to be publicly traded."
"The payment of awards following the three-year award period will be based on performance achieved in accordance with the scale set forth in the plan agreement and may range from 0% to 220% of the initial grant."
"A payout of 100% is earned if the target performance is achieved."
"Contingent share awards for the 2017-2019, 2018-2020, and 2019-2021 periods earn dividend equivalents for the award period, which will be paid to participants or credited to the participants’ deferred compensation plan accounts with the award payout at the end of the period based on the actual number of contingent shares that are earned."
"Any payments made at the end of the award period may be in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both."
"The TSR awards qualify as liability awards, and compensation expense is recognized over the three-year award period based on the fair value of the awards remeasured in each reporting period until settlement of the awards."
"As of December 31, 2019, there was $6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding TSR awards based on the current estimate of fair value."
"This cost is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of 1."

"Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer and in amounts that the Company expects to collect."
"The timing of revenue recognition takes into consideration the various shipping terms applicable to the Company’s sales."
"For most transactions, control passes in accordance with agreed upon delivery terms."
"The Company delivers products to company-owned stores, home centers and other regional or national consumer retail outlets, paint dealers, concessionaires and independent distributors, company-owned distribution networks, and directly to manufacturing companies and retail customers."
"Each product delivered to a third party customer is considered to satisfy a performance obligation."
"Performance obligations generally occur at a point in time and are satisfied when control of the goods passes to the customer."
"The Company is entitled to collection of the sales price under normal credit terms in the regions in which it operates."
"Accounts receivable are recognized when there is an unconditional right to consideration."
"Payment terms vary from customer to customer, depending on creditworthiness, prior payment history and other considerations."
"The Company also provides services by applying coatings to customers' manufactured parts and assembled products and by providing technical support to certain customers."
"Performance obligations are satisfied over time as critical milestones 76 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-KNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsare met and as services are provided."
"PPG is entitled to payment as the services are rendered."
"For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, service revenue constituted approximately 5% of total revenue."

"Reportable Business Segment Information Segment Organization and ProductsPPG is a multinational manufacturer with 9 operating segments that are organized based on the Company’s major products lines."
"The Company’s reportable business segments include the following two segments: Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings."
"The operating segments have been aggregated based on economic similarities, the nature of their products, production processes, end-use markets and methods of distribution."
"The Performance Coatings reportable business segment is comprised of the automotive refinish coatings, aerospace coatings, architectural coatings – Americas and Asia Pacific, architectural coatings - EMEA, and protective and marine coatings operating segments."
"This reportable business segment primarily supplies a variety of protective and decorative coatings, sealants and finishes along with paint strippers, stains and related chemicals, as well as transparencies and transparent armor."
"The Industrial Coatings reportable business segment is comprised of the automotive OEM coatings, industrial coatings, packaging coatings, and the specialty coatings and materials operating segments."
"This reportable business segment primarily supplies a variety of protective and decorative coatings and finishes along with adhesives, sealants, metal pretreatment products, optical monomers and coatings, precipitated silicas and other specialty materials."
"Production facilities and sales for Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings are global."
"PPG’s reportable business segments continue to pursue opportunities to further develop their global reach, including efforts in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America."
"Each of the reportable business segments in which PPG is engaged is highly competitive."
"The diversification of our product lines and the worldwide sales tend to minimize the impact on PPG’s Net sales and Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income of changes in demand in a particular industry or in a particular geographic area."
"The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies ."
"The Company allocates resources to operating segments and evaluates the performance of operating segments based upon segment income, which is income before interest expense – net, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests and excludes certain charges which are considered to be unusual or non-recurring."
"The Company also evaluates performance of operating segments based on working capital reduction, margin growth, and sales volume growth."
"Legacy items include current costs related to former operations of the Company not classified as discontinued operations at the time of the disposal, including pension and other postretirement benefit costs, certain charges for legal matters and certain environmental remediation costs, and certain other charges which are not associated with PPG’s current business portfolio."
"These legacy costs are excluded from the segment income that is used to evaluate the performance of the operating segments."
"Corporate unallocated costs include the costs of corporate staff functions not directly associated with the operating segments, certain legal cases, net of related insurance recoveries and the cost of certain insurance and stock-based compensation programs."
"The service cost component of net periodic pension expense related to current employees of each reportable business segment is allocated to that reportable business segment and the remaining portion of net periodic pension expense is included in the Corporate unallocated costs."
"Product movement between Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings is limited, is accounted for as an inventory transfer, and is recorded at cost plus a mark-up, the impact of which is not significant to the net sales or segment income of the reportable business segments."
"Acquisition-related costs include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees incurred to effect acquisitions."
"These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income."
"Acquisition-related costs also include the impact for the step up to fair value of inventory acquired in certain acquisitions which are included in Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of income."
"Segment assets are the total assets used in the operation of each segment."
"Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, cash held in escrow, short term investments and deferred tax assets."
"Net sales to external customers are attributed to geographic regions based upon the location of the operating unit shipping the product."
