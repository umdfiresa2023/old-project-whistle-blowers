"Ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us."
"Key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations."
"In addition, we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them."
"Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally ."
"Such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property, as well as entities that currently own or operate such property."
"We are subject to such laws, including the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, in the U."
"S."
", and similar foreign and state laws."
"We may have liability as a potentially responsible party with respect to active off-site locations under CERCLA or state equivalents."
"We have sought to resolve our liability as a PRP at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements, which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs."
"Because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required, and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability, our estimates could change."
"Moreover, liability under CERCLA and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several, meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs."
"Our understanding of the financial strength of other PRPs has been considered, where appropriate, in estimating our liabilities."
"Accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve discussed below."
"Our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and, based on information currently available to us, we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations."
"We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury and/or property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment."
"In addition, some of our current properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes, which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation, personal injury and/or property damage."
"While we conduct our operations so as to minimize the risk of incurring such losses, the nature of our business and the types of operations in which we engage create a potential for such losses to occur."
"These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of production, pollution and other environmental damages."
"Depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents, it is possible that the Company’s operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators could be impaired."
"In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our product if they view our safety record as unacceptable."
"This could also cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues."
"However, we believe that the likelihood of an environmental-related catastrophic occurrence or a series of occurrences that could materially affect the Company’s financial position or competitiveness is low."
"We record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated."
"It is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters."
"We may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations."
"It is also possible that other developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws, regulations and orders of regulatory agencies, as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future."
"As this information becomes available, or other relevant developments occur, we will adjust our accrual amounts accordingly."
"While there are still uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur, based upon our evaluation and experience to date, we believe our reserves are adequate."
"We cannot assure you that, as a result of former, current or future operations, there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities."

"9Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Climate ChangeThe growing concerns about climate change and the related imposition by governments of more stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities."
"The Company seeks to capitalize on the “green revolution” by providing solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies, emission control technologies and other similar solutions."
"As demand for, and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase, we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise if new legislation is enacted."
"See page 15 for further discussion on climate change in Item 1A."

"Recent Acquisitions and Joint VenturesOver the last three years, we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures, including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses."
"These acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business, provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries."
"Following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during recent years."
"On October 8, 2013, we announced the expansion of our presence in the electronic materials market with the acquisition of Cambridge Chemical Company, Ltd."
", effective October 1, 2013."
"Based in Cambridge, UK, Cambridge Chemical is a key technology player for producing high purity metal organic chemicals used in the laser market."
"Cambridge Chemical’s technology and products will further strengthen Albemarle’s offerings in the electronic market including LED, semiconductor, OLED and now laser."
"Albemarle will also benefit from a number of R&D and distribution synergies resulting from the acquisition."
"On May 11, 2011, we announced that we had expanded our presence in the biofuels market with the acquisition of Catilin Inc."
", based in Ames, Iowa."
"On September 13, 2010, we announced the purchase of certain property and equipment in Yeosu, South Korea in connection with our plans for building a metallocene polyolefin catalyst and trimethyl gallium manufacturing site."
"The site will effectively mirror Albemarle’s world scale metallocene polyolefin catalyst and TMG capabilities located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana."
"Commercial production of metallocene polyolefin catalysts and co-catalysts began in July 2013 and commercial production of TMG is expected to begin in August 2014."
"On October 27, 2009, we entered into an agreement with Saudi Specialty Chemicals Company, an affiliate of Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, to form a joint venture called Saudi Organometallic Chemicals Company ."
"Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, the two parent companies have built a world-scale organometallics production facility strategically located in the Arabian gulf industrial city of Al-Jubail."
"This facility is now operational and available for full commercial production once customer qualifications are completed."
"EmployeesAs of December 31, 2013, we had 4,231 employees of whom 2,148, or 51%, are employed in the U."
"S."
"; 1,152, or 27%, are employed in Europe; 590, or 14%, are employed in Asia and 341, or 8%, are employed in the Middle East."
"Approximately 14% of our U."
"S."
"employees are unionized."
"We have bargaining agreements at three of our U."
"S."
"locations:•Baton Rouge, Louisiana—United Steel Workers ;•Orangeburg, South Carolina—International Brotherhood of Teamsters-Industrial Trades Division ; and•Pasadena, Texas—USW; Sheet Metal Workers International Association ; United Association of Journeymen & Apprentices of Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry ; and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ."
"We believe that we have good working relationships with these unions, and we have operated without a labor work stoppage at each of these locations for more than 20 years."
"Bargaining agreements expire at our Pasadena, Texas location in 2014, our Baton Rouge, Louisiana location in 2015 and our Orangeburg, South Carolina location in 2016."
"We have two works councils representing the majority of our European sites—Amsterdam, the Netherlands and Bergheim, Germany—covering approximately 900 employees."
"We believe that we have a generally good relationship with these councils and bargaining representatives."
"10Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries During 2013, we recorded workforce reduction charges of approximately $33."
"4 million in connection with the realignment of our operating segments effective January 1, 2014, which will result in a reduction of approximately 230 employees worldwide in 2014."
"During 2012, we recorded workforce reduction charges of approximately $21."

"Item 1A."
"Risk Factors."
"You should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information, including the financial information, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K."
"Adverse conditions in the global economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations."
"A global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products, negatively impacting our operating results."
"Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global economic downturns, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the global economy."
"Our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing."
"As a result, existing or potential customers can delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion."
"Further, suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us."
"If the current weakness in much of the global economy continues for an extended period or deepens significantly, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected."
"In the U."
"S."
", the uncertainty regarding government shutdowns and threatened shutdowns, significant mandated tax increases, government debt ceiling limitations, sequestration and government spending cuts and budget negotiations pose a serious risk for the U."
"S."
"economy and consumer confidence."
"In the event that the U."
"S."
"federal government is unable to achieve a resolution of these issues, there could be an adverse impact on the U."
"S."
"economy which could negatively impact our revenues and earnings."
"Our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy, on a timely basis or at all, could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products."
"Our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly."
"Increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in the pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil, chlorine and metals ."
"We generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers, but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so."
"Our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases, or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility, could adversely affect our margins."
"In addition to raising prices, raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies."
"Constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business."
"11Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries We face competition from other specialty chemical companies, which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products."
"We operate in a highly competitive marketplace, competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers."
"Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service."
"Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources."
"These competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do."
"As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry, changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions."
"Additionally, competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices, which could affect our margins and profitability adversely."
"Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume, shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development."
"If we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position, we could lose market share to our competitors."
"Albemarle’s brands, product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the Company’s reputation."
"Accordingly, the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make false or unsubstantiated claims, implies immoral or improper conduct or is otherwise disparaging to our Company or its products."
"Further, our own actions could hurt such brands, product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity."
"Downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability."
"Downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales."
"Many of our customers are in industries, including the electronics, building and construction and automotive industries, that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions."
"Historically, downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices, and we may experience similar problems in the future."
"A decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability."
"Our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our HPC catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals."
"Our HPC catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products."
"The effectiveness of HPC catalysts diminishes with use, requiring the HPC catalysts to be replaced, on average, once every one to three years."
"The sales of our HPC catalysts, therefore, are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the HPC catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter."
"In addition, the timing and profitability of HPC catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter."
"Sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions, which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods."
"In addition, crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals."
"Changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals."
"Our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications."
"Changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary."
"Customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products."
"For example, many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer."
"Should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price, performance or other considerations, we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements."
"Consequently, it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use."
"Our business, results of operations, cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products."
"12Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products."
"The specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements."
"In order to maintain our margins and remain competitive, we must successfully develop, manufacture and market new or improved products."
"As a result, we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development."
"Ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues."
"Additionally, for any new product program, there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs."
"Moreover, new products may have lower margins than the products they replace."
"We also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products."
"For example, we are experiencing increased competition from large-scale producers of pharmachemicals, particularly from Asian producers, and, our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline, diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities, including sulfur."
"As a result, our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and more cost-effective catalysts products."
"As new products enter the market, our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products."
"If we fail to develop new products, maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will suffer."
"Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
"Protection of our proprietary processes, methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business."
"We generally rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws of the U."
"S."
"and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold, as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights."
"The patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U."
"S."
"Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies."
"Additionally, some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and, even if a patent application has been filed, it may not result in an issued patent."
"If patents are issued to us, those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies."
"We cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable."
"We could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies."
"If we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others, we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes, redesign our products partially or completely, pay to use the technology of others, stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely."
"Even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit, the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits."
"We may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products."
"We also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position."
"While we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise."
"Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber-security breaches."
"Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time."
"These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others."
"We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects."
"The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or 13Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries otherwise adversely affect our business."
"To the extent that any cyber-security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result."
"Our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
"We conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the U."
"S."
"We and our joint ventures currently have 34 facilities located outside the U."
"S."
", including facilities and offices located in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, the Netherlands, the People’s Republic of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom."
"We expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures."
"Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions."
"Risks inherent in international operations include the following:•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U."
"S."
"Dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency;•transportation and other shipping costs may increase;•intellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce;•changes in foreign laws and tax rates or U."
"S."
"In addition, certain of our joint ventures operate, and we have ongoing capital projects in, high-risk regions of the world such as the Middle East and South America."
"Unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a write-down of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cancellation of those capital projects, which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability."
"Our success as a global business will depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions by developing, implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business."
"We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income."
"We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate."
"The financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to U."
"S."
"Dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements."
"Changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U."
"S."
" Dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets, liabilities, net sales, cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses."
"The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the European Union Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling, Korean Won, Chinese Renminbi, Brazilian Real and the U."
"S."
" Dollar ."
"Exchange rates between these currencies and the U."
"S."
" Dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future."
"With respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations, for the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 26% of our net sales were denominated in such currencies."
"Significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the U."
"S."
" Dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency-14Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries denominated debt outstanding."
"In addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency."
"Our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks."
"We incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations."
"In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties."
"Ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts."
"Environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years."
"We expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs."
"Violations of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines, penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices or curtail production."
"If we violate environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, in addition to being required to correct such violations, we can be held liable in administrative, civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations."
"Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally ."
"Such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property, as well as entities that currently own or operate such property."
"Such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict."
"We use, and in the past have used, hazardous substances at many of our facilities, and we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material."
"We also have generated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities."
"Some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination."
"We have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate."
"The nature of our business, including historical operations at our current and former facilities, exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment."
"Additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites, and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable, that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters."
"Contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities."
"At several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist, we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators; however, in the event we make a claim, the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation."
"If our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective, our accrual and/or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially."
"We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change."
"Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject."
"Climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures, among others."
"For example, there has been increasing concern regarding the declining water level of the Dead Sea, from which our joint venture, JBC, produces bromine."
"A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change."
"For example, some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulatory regimes governing greenhouse gas emissions."
"Potentially, additional U."
"S."
"federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions ) and/or “cap and trade” legislation that could have impacts on our operations."
"In addition, we have operations in the European Union, Brazil, China, Japan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the Kyoto Protocol, an 15Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"The first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012."
"An amendment was passed by the UNFCC during the December 2012 Doha climate change talks that would implement a second commitment period through 2020, but the amendment has not entered into legal force pending acceptance by participating countries."
"The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U."
"S."
"and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, fees or restrictions on certain activities."
"While certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control, compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations."
"Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations."
"Even without such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us."
"We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth."
"Furthermore, the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect us."
"Regulation, or the threat of regulation, of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability."
"We manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups."
"For example, for many years we have marketed methyl bromide, a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant."
"In recent years, the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly, driven by the Montreal Protocol of 1990 and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer."
"Completion of the phase-out of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect January 1, 2005 with critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available."
"Over the past decade, there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities, legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries."
"We manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products, which are used in a variety of applications."
"Concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation, or reaction in our markets independent of regulation, that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products."
"In 2009, one of our products, HBCD, was designated by European regulators as a Substance of Very High Concern."
"In February 2011, the European Union included HBCD on a list of substances published under Annex XIV of the REACH regulation."
"Our expectation is that the sale of HBCD could be banned in Europe under the REACH process as early as August 2015, or by 2019 assuming certain applications are authorized during a period of transition to alternative products."
"Also, in August 2013, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants banned HBCD under the Convention effective November 2014, with certain uses exempted to allow time for the development of alternative products."
"A number of countries may ban HBCD immediately in November 2014, allowing for no period of transition thereby eliminating sales of HBCD in such countries."
"Our sales of HBCD approximated 1."
"3%, 1."
"9%, and 2."
"1% of our total annual net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively."
"There is no assurance that we will be able to develop alternative products in the future that generate sales comparable to HBCD."
"Agencies in the European Union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol A and decabromodiphenylethane, both of which we manufacture."
"Additional government regulations, including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants, would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability."
"In addition, the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products, which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability."
"We could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications."
"Our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products."
"If a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed."
"These risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because, in certain instances, we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees."
"A successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers."
"16Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses, any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations."
"Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks."
"These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment and environmental contamination."
"In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals."
"Accordingly, these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole, including our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties."
"Natural disasters and weather-related matters could impact our results of operations."
"In 2005 and again in the third quarter of 2008, major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the U."
"S."
"Gulf Coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials, which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products."
"If similar weather-related matters or other natural disasters occur in the future, they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy."
"The insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures."
"We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered."
"We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation."
"In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all."
"We are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail."
"Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers."
"Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost."
"In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, if at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain."
"We may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility."
"We continually assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner."
"Based on our assessments, we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units, move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility, discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility."
"We also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised, we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations."
"The closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant."
"If we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business."
"The unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business."
"In addition, because of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance is dependent on the continued service of, and on our ability to attract and retain, qualified management, scientific, technical, marketing and support personnel."
"Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel."
"Some of our employees are unionized, represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the U."
"S."
"As of December 31, 2013, we had 4,231 employees."
"Approximately 14% of our 2,148 U."
"S."
"employees are unionized."
"Our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2014, 2015 and 2016."
"In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U."
"S."
"Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements."
"For example, most of our employees in Europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce."
"Although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees, a strike, work stoppage, 17Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs."
"Our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures."
"We currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future."
"The nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties."
"If our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan."
"In that case, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture."
"Also, differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues."
"If these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans, our results of operations could be adversely affected."
"We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business, which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses."
"As part of our business growth strategy, we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future."
"Our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity."
"The expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures, the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully, could result in unanticipated expenses and losses."
"Furthermore, we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures."
"The process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations."
"Although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements, events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business."
"We have several defined benefit pension plans around the world, including in the U."
"S."
", the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and Japan, covering most of our employees."
"The U."
"S."
"plans represent approximately 93% of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide."
"We are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws."
"The amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries."
"During 2011, we made voluntary contributions of $50."
"0 million to our U."
"S."
"qualified defined benefit pension plans."
"Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we anticipate no required cash contributions during 2014 for our U."
"S."
"qualified defined benefit pension plans."
"Additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2014 may vary depending on factors such as asset returns, interest rates, and legislative changes."
"The amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly."
"These contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business."
"18Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including domestic and international terrorist attacks, may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products."
"Chemical-related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the U."
"S."
"and throughout the world."
"As a result, we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities, which increase our overhead expenses."
"We are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the U."
"S."
"We believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered."
"We ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous."
"Bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities, like Washington, D."
"C."
", could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations."
"Broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture."
"The occurrence of extraordinary events, including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products."
"The resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets, or assets used by us, could include loss of life and property damage."
"In addition, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or, if available, may be prohibitively expensive."
"We will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control."
"Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control."
"Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations."
"If we are unable to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or raise additional equity."
"We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity."
"Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition."
"Restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business."
"Our February 2014 credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants."
"These covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility."
"The failure to comply with the covenants in our February 2014 credit agreement, the indentures governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred in the future, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
"See “Financial Condition and Liquidity—Long-Term Debt” in Item 7."
"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 47."
"A downgrade of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase."
"Borrowings under our February 2014 credit agreement and our commercial paper program bear interest at floating rates."
"The rates under the February 2014 credit agreement are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Services ."
"S&P has rated our senior unsecured long-term debt as BBB+ and Moody’s has rated our senior unsecured long-term debt as Baa1."
"S&P has rated our commercial paper as A-2 and Moody’s has rated it as P-2."
"S&P and/or Moody’s may downgrade our ratings in the future."
"The downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on our variable rate borrowings."
"19Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities."
"Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy."
"Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading."
"Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of future financing, could limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities."
"Because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures."
"A significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures."
"As a result, our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us."
"Payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions."
"In addition, there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of non-U."
"S."
"subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us."
"The instruments governing our indebtedness do not limit our acquisitions and may allow us to incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness in relation to acquisitions."
"We have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions."
"A part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement and expand our distribution network."
"The terms of our indebtedness do not limit the number or scale of acquisitions that we may complete."
"Because the consummation of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses involves significant risk, this means that investors in our securities will be subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy."

"On July 3, 2006, we received a Notice of Violation from the U."
"S."
"Environmental Protection Agency Region 4 regarding the implementation of the Pharmaceutical Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards at our plant in Orangeburg, South Carolina."
"The alleged violations involve  the applicability of the specific regulations to certain intermediates manufactured at the plant,  failure to comply with certain reporting requirements,  improper evaluation and testing to properly implement the regulations and  the sufficiency of the leak detection and repair program at the plant."
"In the second quarter of 2011, the Company was served with a complaint by the EPA in the U."
"S."
"District Court for the District of South Carolina, based on the alleged violations set out in the 2006 NOV seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief."
"The complaint was subsequently amended to add the State of South Carolina as a plaintiff."
"We intend to vigorously defend this action."
"Any settlement or finding adverse to us could result in the payment by us of fines, penalties, capital expenditures or some combination thereof."
"At this time, it is not possible to predict with any certainty the outcome of this litigation or the financial impact which may result therefrom."
"However, we do not expect any financial impact to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows."

"OutlookThe 2013 business environment presented a diverse set of challenges in the markets we serve, from a slow global economic recovery, significant pricing pressure on bromine, and an ever-changing landscape in electronics, to the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery partners."
"Despite these continuing challenges, our business fundamentals are sound and we are strategically well-positioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes, managing costs and delivering value to our customers."
"We believe that when the end markets we serve begin to stabilize and resume growth, our businesses will be ready to respond quickly to the improved market conditions and new business opportunities."
"Polymer Solutions: Year-over-year results for 2013 on both the top and bottom line are a reflection of the difficult pricing environment for our portfolio of flame retardants, but we did enjoy mid-single-digit volume growth for both mineral and brominated flame retardants."
"We continue to manage through an uncertain environment characterized by soft demand in certain products and applications and cautious inventory management by our customers, which could continue to challenge the growth curve of this business into 2014."
"Despite these current trends and concerns, we believe that the combination of solid, long-term business fundamentals with our competitive position, product innovations and effective management of raw material inventory inflation will enable us to manage our business through these periods of end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that will come with a sustained economic recovery."
"Our view of third party market indicators and order book trends makes us cautiously optimistic that broad pricing trends for brominated flame retardants have stabilized."
"On a long-term basis, we continue to believe that improving global standards of living and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products."
"Further, the demand environment for antioxidants continues to grow, with new polyolefin plants in China, the U."
"S."
"and the Middle East expected to support strong demand growth for several years forward."
"Based on current production capacities and end market demand, we remain well-positioned for the future."
"Catalysts: Lower metals surcharges, unfavorable foreign currency effects and unfavorable mix in Refinery Catalysts sales have resulted in overall lower year-over-year net sales for our Catalysts segment during 2013."
"However, sales volumes in our Refinery Catalysts businesses were strong as compared to 2012, and are a good indication of the healthy global demand for these products."
"In 2013 we executed several initiatives that strengthened our competitive position and laid the foundation for greater innovation and organic growth going forward, as we successfully started up a polyolefin catalyst center in South Korea and a world class aluminum alkyls facility in Saudi Arabia within our previously announced joint venture there."
"These new units, while unlikely to reach high utilization rates for a few years, are state-of-the-art units designed using the best technology and benefiting from our many years of hands-on operating experience."
"On a longer term basis, we believe increased global demand for petroleum products and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements will drive growth in our refinery catalysts business."
"In addition, we expect growth in our PCS division 29Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries to come from growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, as well as from the LED market, driven by energy efficiency demands."
"Delivering superior end-use performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry, and our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world, those managing new contaminants present in North America tight oil, and those in the Middle East and Asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields."
"Fine Chemistry: In our Fine Chemistry segment, year-over-year results were down in a difficult bromine pricing environment."
"Record volumes and revenue in clear completion fluids was offset by higher fixed costs related to our capacity expansion in Jordan, which we expect to strengthen our competitive position in the markets we serve."
"We believe we can sustain healthy margins with continued focus on the two strategic areas in our Fine Chemistry segment—maximizing our bromine franchise value in the performance chemicals sector and continued growth of our fine chemistry services business."
"On a longer term basis, we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets."
"We believe the global supply/demand gap will tighten as demand for existing and new uses of bromine expand."
"After an exceptional two-year run, clear completion fluids are expected to grow at a healthy rate."
"Factors that could cause a decline in the trajectory of this business include a continuation of the recent destocking and well completion delays that we observed late in 2013, or a meaningful decline in oil prices, or increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling, which could lead to delays in deep water and ultra-deep water spending."
"Fine Chemistry Services has a solid pipeline and good growth in contracts linked to electronic materials and agricultural applications, and although we expect the near term trajectory of growth in this business to be challenging due to the conclusion of several major projects, we expect new projects to offset these losses and establish a foundation for future growth."
"Our technical expertise, manufacturing capabilities and speed to market allow us to develop a preferred outsourcing position serving leading chemical, agrochemical and life science innovators in diverse industries."
"We believe we will continue to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business."
"Corporate and Other: We continue to focus on cash generation, working capital management and process efficiencies."
"Our global effective tax rate was 25."
"0% for 2013, and we expect our global effective tax rate for 2014 to be approximately 25."
"0%; however, our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the U."
"S."
"and other tax jurisdictions."
"Actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations are reflected in Corporate and other as a component of non-operating pension and OPEB plan costs under mark-to-market accounting."
"Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include an actuarial gain of $139."
"0 million, as compared to a loss of $75."
"7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012."

"2 million shares of our common stock during 2013 for approximately $582 million under our existing share repurchase program and the 2013 ASR program, and we may periodically repurchase shares in the future on an opportunistic basis."
"In the first quarter of 2014 we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase $50 million of of our common stock by the end of April 2014."
"Also, in the first quarter of 2014 we increased our quarterly dividend rate to $0."

"Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesEstimates, Assumptions and ReclassificationsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements."
"Listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements."
"Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation."
"Recovery of Long-Lived Assets."
"We evaluate the recovery of our long-lived assets on a reporting unit basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment."
"Income Taxes."
"We assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets."
"Environmental Remediation Liabilities."
"We estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site-specific facts and circumstances."
"Cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing  the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter,  the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and  the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility."
"Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements."
"Revenue RecognitionWe recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable, and has been earned, in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance."
"We recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer, which usually occurs at the time shipment is made."
"Significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis, and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements."
"Our standard terms of delivery are generally included 41Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries in our contracts of sale, order confirmation documents and invoices."
"We recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed."
"We have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts."
"Where the Company incurs pre-production design and development costs under long-term supply contracts, these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist."
"Conversely, these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities."
"Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsWe account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to not be amortized."
"We test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value."
"We estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows."
"Future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes, selling prices, raw material prices, labor and other employee benefit costs, capital additions and other economic or market related factors."
"Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events."
"We use a Weighted Average Cost of Capital approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing."
"Our WACC calculation incorporates industry-weighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective."
"The factors in this calculation are largely external to the Company and, therefore, are beyond our control."
"We test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts."
"The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2013 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date."
"Definite-lived intangible assets, such as purchased technology, patents, customer lists and trade names, are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five to forty years."
"We continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance."
"See Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 beginning on page 53."
"Pension Plans and Other Postretirement BenefitsUnder authoritative accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets."
"As required, we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or OPEB plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date."
"The primary assumptions are as follows:•Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future."
"•Expected Return on Plan Assets—We project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets for these investments."
"These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently."
"•Rate of Compensation Increase—For salary-related plans, we project employees’ annual pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement."
"•Rate of Increase in the Per Capita Cost of Covered Health Care Benefits—Eligible retirees receive fully insured medical benefits with the Company providing a cost sharing benefit subject to a cap."
"The pre-65 and post-65 caps were fully met as of January 1, 2013 and we do not anticipate increases in the cost sharing caps."
"Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year."
"The remaining components of pension and OPEB plan expense, primarily service cost, interest cost and expected return on assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis."
"The market-related value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement."
"During 2013, we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on assets, and mortality scales."
"We consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions."
"In selecting the discount rates for the U."
"S."
"plans, we consider expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis."
"As a result, the Company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments."
"For 2013, the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by Milliman, which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate."
"We believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred 42Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2013 measurement date."
"In selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans, we relied on Aon Hewitt methods, including the Aon Hewitt Top-Quartile and a yield curve derived from fixed-income security yields."
"The yield curve is generally based on a universe containing Aa-graded corporate bonds in the Euro zone without special features or options, which could affect the duration."
"In some countries, the yield curve is based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk."
"Payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve."
"For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments."
"At December 31, 2013, the weighted-average discount rate was increased for the pension plans from 4."
"04% to 5."
"00% and for the OPEB plans from 4."
"00% to 5."
"03% to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2013 measurement date."
"In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocations of plan assets to these investments."
"For the years 2013 and 2012, the weighted-average expected rate of return on domestic pension plan assets was 7."
"25% and 8."
"25%, respectively."
"The weighted-average expected rate of return on U."

"At December 31, 2013, the assumed weighted-average rate of compensation increase changed to 2."
"78% from 3."
"37% for the pension plans."

"43Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Income TaxesWe use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates."
"Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered."
"Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not."
"Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities."
"Deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers."
"A valuation allowance, reducing deferred tax assets, is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized."
"The realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character."
"Although realization is not assured, we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized."
"We only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position."
"Once the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized."
"Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense."
"We are subject to income taxes in the U."
"S."
"and numerous foreign jurisdictions."
"We are no longer subject to U."
"S."
"federal income tax audits by tax authorities for years prior to 2010 since the IRS has completed a review of our income tax returns through 2007 and our statute of limitations has expired for 2008 and 2009 except for the amount of any carryforward to 2010."
"We also are no longer subject to any U."
"S."
"state income tax audits prior to 2004."
"With respect to jurisdictions outside the U."
"S."
", we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2006."
"During 2013, the German tax authorities continued the audit of two of our German subsidiaries for 2006 through 2009 that began in 2011, and the Chinese tax authorities completed an audit of one of our Chinese subsidiaries for 2006 through 2010 that began in 2011."
"During 2011, we completed tax audits for one of our Belgian companies for 2008 and 2009, our Japanese company for 2006 through 2010, and two of our Chinese companies through 2010."
"No significant tax was assessed as a result of the completed audits."
"While we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position."
"Accordingly, additional provisions on federal and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved."
"Since the timing of resolutions and/or closure of tax audits are uncertain, it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months."
"Our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions, relating to a number of issues, up to approximately $2."
"8 million as a result of closure of tax statutes."
"We have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries."
"Our foreign earnings are computed under U."
"S."
"federal tax earnings and profits principles."
"In general, to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these E&P amounts, deferred taxes have not been provided, as they are essentially permanent in duration."
"The determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable."
"We provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested."
"Stock-based Compensation ExpenseThe fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model."
"The fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures."
"Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant."
"To the extent restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses."
"44Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Internal Control Over Financial ReportingSection 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K."
"Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting."
"In order to make our assertion, we are required to identify material financial and operational processes, document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls."
"See “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” in Item 8."
"We have a dedicated SOX 404 team to facilitate ongoing internal control testing, provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff in their control processes and assist in the overall assessment of internal control over financial reporting."
"Status and updates are provided to executive management and our Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors on an ongoing basis."
"We also retain accounting firms other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with SOX 404."
"Our SOX 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world, including participation by our business and functional groups."
"We view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it provides us an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us a more effective company."

"Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we may be designated as a PRP, and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites."
"Management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a PRP, our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis."
"Further, almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated, studied and in many cases settled."
"In de minimis situations, our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement, enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a PRP, except for remote contingencies."
"In other than de minimis PRP matters, our records indicate that unresolved PRP exposures should be immaterial."
"We accrue and expense our proportionate share of PRP costs."

"Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued accounting guidance that requires entities to disclose information about financial instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position or subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement."
"In January 2013, the FASB issued additional guidance that limits the scope of these new requirements to certain derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions."
"These amendments became effective on January 1, 2013 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements."
"In February 2013, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires companies to present either in a single note or on the face of the financial statements the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification."
"If a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety, companies would instead cross reference to the related footnote for additional information."
"These amendments became effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2013 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements."
"In February 2013, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires entities that have obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements and for which the total amount is fixed at the reporting date to measure such obligations as the sum of  the amount the entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors, and  any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors."
"Entities are also required to disclose the nature, amount and any other relevant information about such obligations."
"This accounting guidance will become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013 and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for obligations that exist at the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year of adoption."
"We do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements."
"In March 2013, the FASB issued accounting guidance that clarifies a parent company’s accounting for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment when the parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity."
"The guidance clarifies that the sale of an investment in a foreign entity includes both  events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity, and  events that result in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately before the acquisition date ."
"Accordingly, the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment should be released into net income upon the occurrence of those events."
"This accounting guidance will become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, and should be applied prospectively to derecognition events occurring after the effective date."
"The impact of these new requirements on our financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of derecognition events, if any, that may occur in the future related to any of our foreign entities."
"In July 2013, the FASB issued accounting guidance designed to reduce diversity in practice of financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists."
"These new requirements become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013."

" Dollar ."
"In response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods, we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings."
"We manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use, from time to time, of foreign currency forward contracts."
"The principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with global operating activities."
"The counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships."
"We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties."
"However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties."
"We do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes."
"The primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges, in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures."
"In the event a natural hedge is not available, we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure, generally expiring within one year."
"While these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged."
"Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations."

"MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 ."
"Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States."
"Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013."
"In making this assessment, management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ."
"Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States."
"The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal control."
"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein."

"59Albemarle Corporation and SubsidiariesNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:Basis of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Albemarle Corporation and our wholly owned, majority owned and controlled subsidiaries."
"Unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms “Albemarle,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “the Company” mean Albemarle Corporation and our consolidated subsidiaries."
"We apply the equity method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest from 20% to 50% or where we exercise significant influence over the related investee’s operations."
"All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation."
"Estimates, Assumptions and ReclassificationsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements."
"Actual results could differ from those estimates."
"Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation."
"Revenue RecognitionWe recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable, and has been earned, in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance."
"We recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer, which usually occurs at the time shipment is made."
"Significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis, and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements."
"Our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale, order confirmation documents and invoices."
"We recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed."
"We have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts."
"Where the Company incurs pre-production design and development costs under long-term supply contracts, these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist."
"Conversely, these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities."
"Performance and Life Cycle GuaranteesWe provide customers certain performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees."
"These guarantees entitle the customer to claim compensation if the product does not conform to performance standards originally agreed upon."
"Performance guarantees relate to minimum technical specifications that products produced with the delivered product must meet, such as yield and product quality."
"Life cycle guarantees relate to minimum periods for which performance of the delivered product is guaranteed."
"When either performance guarantees or life cycle guarantees are contractually agreed upon, an assessment of the appropriate revenue recognition treatment is evaluated."
"When testing or modeling of historical results predict that the performance or life cycle criteria will be satisfied, revenue is recognized in accordance with shipping terms at the time of delivery."
"When testing or modeling of historical results predict that the performance or life cycle criteria may not be satisfied, we bill the customer upon shipment and defer the related revenue and cost associated with these products."
"These deferrals are released to earnings when the contractual period expires."
"Shipping and Handling CostsAmounts billed to customers in a sales transaction related to shipping and handling have been classified as net sales and the cost incurred by us for shipping and handling has been classified as cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of income."
"In addition, taxes billed to customers in a sales transaction are presented in the consolidated statements of income on a net basis."
"Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash and highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risks and original maturities of three months or less."
"60Albemarle Corporation and SubsidiariesNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSInventoriesInventories are stated at lower of cost or market with cost determined primarily on the first-in, first-out basis."
"Cost is determined on the weighted-average basis for a small portion of our inventories at foreign plants and our stores, supplies and other inventory."
"A portion of our domestic produced finished goods and raw materials are determined on the last-in, first-out basis."
"Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment include costs of assets constructed, purchased or leased under a capital lease, related delivery and installation costs and interest incurred on significant capital projects during their construction periods."
"Expenditures for renewals and betterments also are capitalized, but expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred."
"Costs associated with yearly planned major maintenance are deferred and amortized over 12 months or until the same major maintenance activities must be repeated, whichever is shorter."
"The cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and gains or losses thereon are included in income."
"Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets."
"We have a policy where our internal engineering group provides asset life guidelines for book purposes."
"These guidelines are reviewed against the economic life of the business for each project and asset life is determined as the lesser of the manufacturing life or the “business” life."
"The engineering guidelines are reviewed periodically."
"We evaluate historical and expected undiscounted operating cash flows of our business segments to determine the future recoverability of any property, plant and equipment recorded."
"Property, plant and equipment is re-evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable."
"The costs of brine wells, leases and royalty interests are primarily amortized over the estimated average life of the field on a straight-line basis."
"On a yearly basis for all fields, this approximates a units-of-production method based upon estimated reserves and production volumes."
"InvestmentsInvestments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee."
"Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investee’s board of directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate."
"Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investments in equity-method investees in the consolidated balance sheets as Investments and our share of investees’ earnings or losses together with other-than temporary impairments in value as Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments in the consolidated statements of income."
"Certain mutual fund investments are accounted for as trading equities and are marked-to-market on a monthly basis through the consolidated statements of income."
"Investments in joint ventures and nonmarketable securities of immaterial entities are estimated based upon the overall performance of the entity where financial results are not available on a timely basis."
"Environmental Compliance and RemediationEnvironmental compliance costs include the cost of purchasing and/or constructing assets to prevent, limit and/or control pollution or to monitor the environmental status at various locations."
"These costs are capitalized and depreciated based on estimated useful lives."
"Environmental compliance costs also include maintenance and operating costs with respect to pollution prevention and control facilities and other administrative costs."
"Such operating costs are expensed as incurred."
"Environmental remediation costs of facilities used in current operations are generally immaterial and are expensed as incurred."
"On an undiscounted basis, we accrue for environmental remediation costs and post-remediation costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations at facilities or off-plant disposal sites in the accounting period in which responsibility is established and when the related costs are estimable."
"In developing these cost estimates, we evaluate currently available facts regarding each site, with consideration given to existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, the financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and other factors, subject to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process."
"Additionally, these estimates are reviewed periodically, with adjustments to the accruals recorded as necessary."
"61Albemarle Corporation and SubsidiariesNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSResearch and Development ExpensesOur research and development expenses related to present and future products are expensed as incurred."
"These expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and other overheads, as well as outside service and consulting costs incurred for specific programs."
"Our U."
"S."
"facilities in Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana and our global facilities in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, China and Korea form the capability base for our contract research and custom manufacturing businesses."
"These business areas provide research and scale-up services primarily to innovative life science companies."
"Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsWe account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance that requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets not be amortized."
"We test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value."
"We estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows."
"Future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes, selling prices, raw material prices, labor and other employee benefit costs, capital additions and other economic or market related factors."
"Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events."
"We use a Weighted Average Cost of Capital approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing."
"Our WACC calculation incorporates industry-weighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective."
"The factors in this calculation are largely external to our company, and therefore, are beyond our control."
"We test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts."
"The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2013 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date."
"Definite-lived intangible assets, such as purchased technology, patents, customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally for periods ranging from five to forty years."
"We continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance."
"See Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles."
"”Pension Plans and Other Postretirement BenefitsUnder authoritative accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets."
"As required, we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date."
"The primary assumptions are as follows:•Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future."
"•Expected Return on Plan Assets—We project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans, as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets for these investments."
"These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently."
"•Rate of Compensation Increase—For salary-related plans, we project employees’ annual pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement."
"•Rate of Increase in the Per Capita Cost of Covered Health Care Benefits—Eligible retirees receive fully insured medical benefits with the Company providing a cost sharing benefit subject to a cap."
"The pre-65 and post-65 caps were fully met as of January 1, 2013 and we do not anticipate increases in the cost sharing caps."
"Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year."
"The remaining components of pension and OPEB plan expense, primarily service cost, interest cost and expected return on assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis."
"The market-related value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement."
"During 2013, we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on assets, and mortality scales."
"We consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions."
"In selecting the discount rates for the U."
"S."
"plans, we consider expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis."
"As a result, the Company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments."
"For 2013, the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique 62Albemarle Corporation and SubsidiariesNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSdeveloped by Milliman, which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate."
"We believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2013 measurement date."
"In selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans, we relied on Aon Hewitt methods, including the Aon Hewitt Top-Quartile and a yield curve derived from fixed-income security yields."
"The yield curve is generally based on a universe containing Aa-graded corporate bonds in the Euro zone without special features or options, which could affect the duration."
"In some countries, the yield curve is based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk."
"Payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve."
"For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments."
"In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments."
"In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates."
"Employee Savings PlansCertain of our employees participate in our defined contribution 401 employee savings plan, which is generally available to all U."
"S."
"full-time salaried and non-union hourly employees and to employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that provides for such participation."
"With respect to our foreign subsidiaries, we have a plan in the Netherlands similar to a collective defined contribution plan."
"Deferred Compensation PlanWe maintain an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan that was adopted in 2001 and subsequently amended."
"The purpose of the EDCP is to provide current tax planning opportunities as well as supplemental funds upon the retirement or death of certain of our employees."
"The EDCP is intended to aid in attracting and retaining employees of exceptional ability by providing them with these benefits."
"We also maintain a Benefit Protection Trust that was created to provide a source of funds to assist in meeting the obligations of the EDCP, subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of our insolvency."
"Assets of the Trust are consolidated in accordance with authoritative guidance."
"The assets of the Trust consist primarily of mutual fund investments and cash and cash equivalents."
"Stock-based Compensation ExpenseThe fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model."
"The fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures."
"Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant."
"To the extent restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses."
"Income TaxesWe use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates."
"Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered."
"Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not."
"Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities."
"Deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers."
"A valuation allowance, reducing deferred tax assets, is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized."
"The realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character."
"Although realization is not assured, we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized."
"63Albemarle Corporation and SubsidiariesNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSWe only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position."
"Once the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized."
"Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities under current accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions are included in income tax expense."
"We have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries."
"Our foreign earnings are computed under U."
"S."
"federal tax earnings and profits, or E&P, principles."
"In general, to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these E&P amounts, deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration."
"The determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable."
"We provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested."
"Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeAccumulated other comprehensive income is comprised principally of foreign currency translation adjustments and net prior service benefit for our defined benefit plans and related deferred income taxes in accordance with current accounting guidance."
"Foreign Currency TranslationThe assets and liabilities of all foreign subsidiaries were prepared in their respective functional currencies and translated into U."
"S."
"Dollars based on the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates, while income and expenses were translated at average exchange rates for the periods presented."
"Translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of equity."
"Our consolidated statements of income include foreign exchange transaction losses of $10."
"6 million, $4."
"9 million and $3."
"6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively."
"Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use of foreign currency forward contracts from time to time, which generally expire within one year."
"The principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the financial risks and costs associated with global operating activities."
"While these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are generally expected to be offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged."
"Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income, but generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations."
"The counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships."
"We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties."
"However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties."
"We do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes."
"At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional values totaling $321."
"4 million and $274."
"0 million, respectively."
"64Albemarle Corporation and SubsidiariesNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSRecently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued accounting guidance that requires entities to disclose information about financial instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position or subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement."
"In January 2013, the FASB issued additional guidance that limits the scope of these new requirements to certain derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions."
"These amendments became effective on January 1, 2013 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements."
"In February 2013, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires companies to present either in a single note or on the face of the financial statements the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification."
"If a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety, companies would instead cross reference to the related footnote for additional information."
"These amendments became effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2013 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements."
"In February 2013, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires entities that have obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements and for which the total amount is fixed at the reporting date to measure such obligations as the sum of  the amount the entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors, and  any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors."
"Entities are also required to disclose the nature, amount and any other relevant information about such obligations."
"This accounting guidance will become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013 and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for obligations that exist at the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year of adoption."
"We do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements."
"In March 2013, the FASB issued accounting guidance that clarifies a parent company’s accounting for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment when the parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity."
"The guidance clarifies that the sale of an investment in a foreign entity includes both  events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity, and  events that result in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately before the acquisition date ."
"Accordingly, the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment should be released into net income upon the occurrence of those events."
"This accounting guidance will become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, and should be applied prospectively to derecognition events occurring after the effective date."
"The impact of these new requirements on our financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of derecognition events, if any, that may occur in the future related to any of our foreign entities."
"In July 2013, the FASB issued accounting guidance designed to reduce diversity in practice of financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists."
"These new requirements become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013."
"We do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements."

"On October 13, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the number of shares the Company is permitted to repurchase under our share repurchase program up to a maximum of five million shares."
"On February 12, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized another increase in the number of shares the Company is permitted to repurchase under our share repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is now permitted to repurchase up to a maximum of 15 million shares, including those shares previously authorized but not yet repurchased."

"This purchase was funded through a combination of available cash on hand and debt."
"The Company determined that the accelerated share repurchase agreement met the criteria to be accounted for as a forward contract indexed to its stock and was therefore treated as an equity instrument."
"Under the terms of the agreement, on December 19, 2013, the transaction was completed and we received a final settlement of 1,384,011 shares, calculated based on the daily Rule 10b-18 volume-weighted average prices of the Company’s common stock over the term of the agreement, less a forward price adjustment amount of approximately $1."
