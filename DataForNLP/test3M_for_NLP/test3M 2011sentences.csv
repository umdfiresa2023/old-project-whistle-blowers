"discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii, item 7, “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations."
"”   * results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic and capital markets conditions."
"the company operates in more than 65 countries and derives approximately two-thirds of its revenues from outside the united states."
"  * the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital."
"the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m."
"the company currently has an aa- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from standard & poor’s and an aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from moody’s investors service."
"this evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk,   9 table of contents   as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting."
"the company’s current ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders."
"failure to maintain the current ratings level would adversely affect the company’s cost of funds and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets."
"  * the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences."
"  * foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings."
"because the company’s financial statements are denominated in u."
"s."
"dollars and approximately two-thirds of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states, the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the u."
"s."
"dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies."
"  * the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market."
"this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products."
"there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful."
"  * the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors."
"the company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products."
"it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future."
"any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company."
"in addition, while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company."
"  * acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results."
"the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure."
"with respect to acquisitions, future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies."
"  * the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated."
"the company utilizes various tools, such as lean six sigma, to improve operational efficiency and productivity."
"there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized."
"  * security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the company and its customers and suppliers, and expose the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation."
"in the ordinary course of business, the company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities."
"additionally, the company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information."
"despite security measures and business continuity plans, the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events."
"any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the company’s business."

"foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, or other matters."
"the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict."
"various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law."
"a future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period."

"asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders’ equity."
"while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date."
"  pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination."
"two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability measurement."
"see note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses."
"  the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans."
"the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year."
"the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits."

"this includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses."
"these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant."
"for instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group."
"impairments recorded in 2009 related to restructuring actions are discussed in note 4."
"  in june 2009, 3m’s security systems division was notified that the uk government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3m’s existing uk passport contracts in october 2010."
"as a result of this event, in june 2009, 3m tested the long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability and also reassessed their remaining useful lives."
"in addition, 3m tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level."
"the result of the june 2009 test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity indicated that the asset grouping’s carrying amount of approximately $54 million exceeded the remaining expected cash flows."
"accordingly, 3m recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $13 million in the second quarter of 2009 to write these assets down to their fair value."
"in addition, accelerated depreciation/amortization was taken over the period june 2009 through the date of expiration of the contract based on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets."
"  3m goodwill totaled approximately $7."
"0 billion as of december 31, 2011."
"3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year."
"impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit."
"reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics."
"at 3m, reporting units generally correspond to a division."
"3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing."
"  an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit."
"the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis."
"3m typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows."
"3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions."
"  31 table of contents   as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, effective in the first quarter of 2011, 3m made certain product moves between its business segments."
"for those changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact to reporting units."
"during the first quarter of 2011, the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed."
"the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2011 annual impairment test and is in the context of the segment structure that existed at that time."
"  as of september 30, 2011, 3m had 38 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 76 percent of the goodwill."
"these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3m purification inc."
", occupational health and environmental safety, optical systems, infection prevention, security systems, 3m espe, industrial adhesives and tapes, communication markets, abrasive systems and health information systems."
"  the fair values for 3m purification inc."
"and optical systems, based on fourth quarter 2011 testing, were both in excess of carrying value by approximately 35 percent, while security systems was in excess of carrying value by 38 percent, all with no impairment indicated."
"as part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter, 3m used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for these divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors."
"the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring."
"the fair values for all other significant reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than 40 percent."
"  in 2011, 3m primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units, to determine fair values."
"goodwill is testing for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year."
"based on fourth-quarter 2011 testing, 3m’s estimated fair value when valuing each reporting unit individually would aggregate to approximately $68 billion, implying a control premium of 35 percent when compared to 3m’s market value of approximately $50 billion at september 30, 2011."
"at december 31, 2011, 3m’s market value was approximately $57 billion, implying a control premium of 19 percent."
"the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3m’s total company estimated fair value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company."
"3m’s market value at both september 30, 2011 and december 31, 2011 was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately $17 billion and $16 billion, respectively."
"3m is an integrated materials enterprise, thus; many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis."
"based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2011, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units."
"  factors which could result in future impairment charges, among others, include changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates."
"these risk factors are discussed in item 1a, “risk factors,” of this document."
"as of december 31, 2011, 3m had approximately $1 billion of goodwill related to 3m purification inc."
", $750 million related to optical systems and $500 million related to security systems."
"if future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3m would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired."
"3m will continue to monitor its reporting units in 2012 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment."
"  income taxes:   the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions."
"the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits."
"the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due."
"the company follows guidance provided by asc 740, income taxes, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities ."
"the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities."
"if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result."
"if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary."

"the model used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon."
"the model used analyzed 18 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company."
"this model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results."
"foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased in 2011, primarily due to increases in exposures, which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model."
"interest rate volatility decreased in 2011 because interest rates are currently very low and are projected to remain low, based on forward rates."
"the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures."

"the global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $43 million per year."
"derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure."

"the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america."
"where necessary, the financial statements reflect estimates based on management’s judgment."
"  management has established and maintains a system of internal accounting and other controls for the company and its subsidiaries."
"this system and its established accounting procedures and related controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies and procedures are implemented by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and fairly presented."
"the company’s system of internal control is supported by widely communicated written policies, including business conduct policies, which are designed to require all employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of company affairs."
"internal auditors continually review the accounting and control system."
"  3m company   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting."
"management conducted an assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework."
"based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of december 31, 2011, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective."
"  the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2011 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2011."
"  also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2011, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ."
"  the company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting."
"  our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits."
"  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board ."
"  those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects."
"  our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation."
"  our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk."
"  our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances."
"we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions."
"  a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"  because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"  also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."

"  foreign currency translation: local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the united states."
"assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at year-end exchange rates."
"income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year."
"cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity."
"  although local currencies are typically considered as the functional currencies outside the united states, under accounting standards codification 830, foreign currency matters, the reporting currency of a foreign entity’s parent is assumed to be that entity’s functional currency when the economic environment of a foreign entity is highly inflationary—generally when its cumulative inflation is approximately 100 percent or more for the three years that precede the beginning of a reporting period."
"3m has a subsidiary in venezuela with operating income representing less than 1."
"0 percent of 3m’s consolidated operating income for 2011."
"3m determined that the cumulative inflation rate of venezuela in november 2009 and since has exceeded 100 percent."
"accordingly, the financial statements of the venezuelan subsidiary were remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent beginning january 1, 2010."
"  regulations in venezuela require the purchase and sale of foreign currency to be made at official rates of exchange that are fixed from time to time by the venezuelan government."
"certain laws in the country, however, provided an exemption for the purchase and sale of certain securities and resulted in an indirect “parallel” market through which companies obtained foreign currency without having to purchase it from venezuela’s commission for the administration of foreign exchange ."
"in may 2010, the venezuelan government took control of the previously freely-traded parallel market."
"the government-controlled rate that emerged under the new transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities is not as unfavorable as the previous parallel rate in comparison to the official rates."
"as previously disclosed, as of december 31, 2009, 3m changed to use of the parallel exchange rate for translation of the financial statements of its venezuelan subsidiary."
"beginning january 1, 2010, as discussed above, the financial statements of the venezuelan subsidiary are remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent."
"this remeasurement utilized the parallel rate through may 2010 and the sitme rate thereafter."
"  the company continues to monitor circumstances relative to its venezuelan subsidiary."
"other factors notwithstanding, the change in functional currency of this subsidiary and associated remeasurement beginning january 1, 2010 as a result of venezuela’s economic environment decreased net sales of the venezuelan subsidiary by approximately two-thirds in 2010 in comparison to 2009, but did not otherwise have a material impact on operating income and 3m’s consolidated results of operations."
"  reclassifications: certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation."
"  revisions: the company revised the amounts previously presented for cash used in investing activities and cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2010 by $63 million."
"this revision related to purchases of additional shares of non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries."
"these immaterial revisions increased cash used in financing activities and decreased cash used in investing activities."
"  use of estimates: the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u."
"s."
"generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period."
"actual results could differ from these estimates."
"  cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired."
"  50 table of contents   marketable securities: the classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is dependent upon management’s intended holding period, the security’s maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions."
"if management intends to hold the securities for longer than one year as of the balance sheet date, they are classified as non-current."
"3m reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by asc 320, investments-debt and equity securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-temporary”."
"a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity."
"such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary."
"the factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors."
"  investments: investments primarily include equity and cost method investments, available-for-sale equity investments and real estate not used in the business."
"available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value."
"unrealized gains and losses relating to investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity."
"  other assets: other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and other long-term assets."
"investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid."
"cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in “purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “proceeds from sale of marketable securities and investments,” respectively."
"  inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis."
"  property, plant and equipment: property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost."
"depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets."
"the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from 10 to 40 years, with the majority in the range of 20 to 40 years."
"the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to 15 years, with the majority in the range of five to 10 years."
"fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal."
"upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations."
"property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable."
"an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition."
"the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value."
"fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis."
"  conditional asset retirement obligations: a liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made."
"conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the company."
"the obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques."
"over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets."
"the asset retirement obligation liability was $79 million and $74 million, respectively, at december 31, 2011 and 2010."
"  goodwill: goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination."
"goodwill is not amortized."
"goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired."
"impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit."
"reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics."
"3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing."
"an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit."
"the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis."
"the price/earnings ratio is adjusted, if necessary, to take into consideration the market value of the company."
"  51 table of contents   intangible assets: intangible assets include patents, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party."
"intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized."
"intangible assets with a definite life are amortized generally on a straight-line basis, with useful lives ranging from one to 20 years."
"indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired."
"intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable."
"an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset."
"the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value."
"fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis."
"costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in “research, development and related expenses."
"”  restructuring actions: restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment of assets associated with such actions."
"employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans."
"these charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions."
"severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees’ remaining service periods."
"contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the company."
"asset impairment charges related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values."
"  revenue recognition: the company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk."
"revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have substantively transferred to customers."
"this condition normally is met when the product has been delivered or upon performance of services."
"the company records estimated reductions to revenue or records expense for customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates and free goods, at the time of the initial sale."
"these sales incentives are accounted for in accordance with asc 605, revenue recognition."
"the estimated reductions of revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served."
"since the company serves numerous markets, the rebate programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives."
"free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales."
"sales, use, value-added and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue."
"  the vast majority of 3m’s sales agreements are for standard products and services with customer acceptance occurring upon delivery of the product or performance of the service."
"however, to a limited extent 3m also enters into agreements that involve multiple elements, software, or non-standard terms and conditions."
"  for non-software multiple-element arrangements, in connection with 3m’s prospective adoption of accounting standards updated no."
" 2009-13, multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force, to new or materially modified arrangements beginning in 2011, the company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when they have stand-alone value to the customer, they have been accepted by the customer, and for which there are only customary refund or return rights."
"arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method."
"the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence if available, third-party evidence if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available."
"estimated selling price is determined in a manner consistent with that used to establish the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis."
"for applicable pre-existing arrangements, 3m recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the fair values of the undelivered items are known and allocation of consideration to the delivered items is most often based on the residual method."
"in addition to the preceding conditions under asu no."
" 2009-13 and for applicable pre-existing arrangements, equipment revenue is not recorded until the installation has been completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation or if installation is essential to the functionality of the equipment."
"installation revenues are not recorded until installation has been completed."
"  for arrangements falling within software revenue recognition standards and that do not involve significant production, modification, or customization, revenue for each software or software-related element   52 table of contents   is recognized when the company has vsoe of the fair value of all of the undelivered elements and applicable criteria have been met for the delivered elements."
"when the arrangements involve significant production, modification or customization, long-term construction-type accounting involving proportional performance is generally employed."
"  for prepaid service contracts, sales revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, unless historical evidence indicates the costs are incurred on other than a straight-line basis."
"license fee revenue is recognized as earned, and no revenue is recognized until the inception of the license term."
"  on occasion, agreements will contain milestones, or 3m will recognize revenue based on proportional performance."
"for these agreements, and depending on the specifics, 3m may recognize revenue upon completion of a substantive milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to date compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred."
"  accounts receivable and allowances: trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest."
"the company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items."
"the allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales returns."
"the company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and historical sales returns."
"the company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly."
"the company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers."
"  advertising and merchandising: these costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $518 million in 2011, $512 million in 2010 and $414 million in 2009."
"  research, development and related expenses: these costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of income."
"research, development and related expenses totaled $1."
"570 billion in 2011, $1."
"434 billion in 2010 and $1."
"293 billion in 2009."
"research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1."
"036 billion in 2011, $919 million in 2010 and $838 million in 2009."
"related expenses primarily include technical support provided by 3m to customers who are using existing 3m products; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; and amortization of acquired patents."
"  internal-use software: the company capitalizes direct costs of materials and services used in the development of internal-use software."
"amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the software’s use."
"amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or capital leases within property, plant and equipment."
"  environmental: environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed."
"reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action."
"environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives."
"  income taxes: the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach."
"under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities."
"the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists."
"as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, the company recorded $82 million and $128 million, respectively, of valuation allowances."
"the company follows accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes to record uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions ."
"  earnings per share: the difference in the weighted average 3m shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the company’s stock-based compensation plans."
"certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2011, 2010 and 2009 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders because they would not have had a dilutive effect ."
"as discussed in note 10, the conditions for conversion related to the company’s convertible notes were not met."
"if the conditions for conversion were met, 3m could have chosen to pay in cash and/or common stock; however, if this occurred, the  53 table of contents   company had the intent and ability to settle this debt security in cash."
"accordingly, there was no impact on diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders."
"as discussed in note 10, in september 2011, 3m redeemed all remaining convertible notes, which were otherwise due in 2032."
"the computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 follow:   earnings per share computations     2011   2010   2009   numerator:               net income attributable to 3m   $ 4,283   $ 4,085   $ 3,193   denominator:               denominator for weighted average 3m common shares outstanding — basic   708."

"63   $ 4."
"52     stock-based compensation: the company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the general employees’ stock purchase plan ."
"under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests."
"refer to note 16 for additional information."
"  comprehensive income: total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of changes in equity."
"accumulated other comprehensive income is composed of foreign currency translation effects, defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments."
"  derivatives and hedging activities: all derivative instruments within the scope of asc 815, derivatives and hedging, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value."
"the company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility."
"all hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with u."
"s."
"generally accepted accounting principles."
"if the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings."
"instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings."
"cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated hedge relationships."
"the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives."
"  credit risk: the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts."
"however, the company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments."
"the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties."
"3m enters into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions."
"a master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions."
"the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties."
"3m has credit support agreements in place with two of its primary derivatives counterparties."
"under these agreements, either party is required to post eligible collateral when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds specified thresholds, thus limiting credit exposure for both parties."
"for presentation purposes on 3m’s consolidated balance sheet, the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities are presented on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may qualify for net presentation."
"  fair value measurements: 3m follows asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis."
"under the standard, fair   54 table of contents   value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date."
"the standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available."
"observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company."
"unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances."
"the hierarchy is broken down into three levels."
"level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities."
"level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly."
"level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability."
"categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement."
"  acquisitions: the company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with asc 805, business combinations."
"this standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination."
"certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting."
"3m applies this standard to business combinations and adjustments to an acquired entity’s deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after december 31, 2008."
"pre-2009 business combinations were accounted for under a former standard which, among other aspects, required transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs to be included in the acquisition purchase accounting and did not require the recognition of certain contingent consideration as of the acquisition date."
"for 3m, these standards were effective beginning april 1, 2009."
"the company discloses the additional required information."

"  fair value measurements   3m follows asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis."
"under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date."
"the standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available."
"observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company."
"unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances."
"the hierarchy is broken down into three levels."
"level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities."
"level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly."
"level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability."
"categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement."
"  assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:   for 3m, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities, available-for-sale investments and certain derivative instruments."
"derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and most net investment hedges."
"the information in the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities."
"separately, there were no material fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the company’s financial statements on a recurring basis for 2011 and 2010."
"  3m uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities."
"following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value."
"  available-for-sale marketable securities — except auction rate securities:   marketable securities, except auction rate securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources."
"a weighted average price is used for these securities."
"market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources."
"these multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used."
"3m classifies u."
"s."
"treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities are classified as level 2."
"marketable securities are discussed further in note 9."
"  available-for-sale marketable securities — auction rate securities only:   as discussed in note 9, auction rate securities held by 3m failed to auction since the second half of 2007."
"as a result, investments in auction rate securities are valued utilizing third-party indicative bid levels in markets that are not active and broker-dealer valuation models that utilize inputs such as current/forward interest rates, current market conditions and credit default swap spreads."
"3m classifies these securities as level 3."
"  available-for-sale investments:   investments include equity securities that are traded in an active market."
"closing stock prices are readily available from active markets and are used as being representative of fair value."
"3m classifies these securities as level 1."
"  derivative instruments:   the company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of asc 815, derivatives and hedging, are required to be recorded at fair value."
"the company’s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price swaps, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value."
"net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3m’s net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under asc 820, as the debt   94 table of contents   used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value."
"  3m has determined that foreign currency forwards and commodity price swaps will be considered level 1 measurements as these are traded in active markets which have identical asset or liabilities, while currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps will be considered level 2."
"for level 2 derivatives, 3m uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset."
"these inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates."
"the level 2 derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters."
"industry standard data providers are 3m’s primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model."

"in june 2009, 3m was notified that the uk government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3m’s existing uk passport contracts in october 2010."
"accordingly, 3m tested the long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability which indicated that the asset grouping’s carrying amount exceeded the remaining expected cash flows."

"the carrying amount of long-term debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and by the designation of fixed rate eurobond securities issued by the company as hedging instruments of the company’s net investment in its european subsidiaries."
"3m’s fixed-rate bonds were trading at a premium at december 31, 2011 and 2010 due to the low interest rates and tightening of 3m’s credit spreads."

"unless otherwise stated, the company is vigorously defending all such litigation."
"  process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings   many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are actual damages and are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties."
"assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions."
"the company complies with the requirements of asc topic 450, contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable."
"where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate."
"the company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established reserves if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made."
"the company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable  98 table of contents   or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred."
"  the company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim, and records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered."
"for those insured matters where the company has taken a reserve, the company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the company’s insurance program."
"for those insured matters where the company has not taken a reserve because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred."
"  because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities."
"a future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded."
"the company currently believes that such future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company, taking into account its significant available insurance coverage."
"based on experience and developments, the company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable."
"where appropriate, the company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities."
"as a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the company could change in the future."
"  respirator mask/asbestos litigation   as of december 31, 2011, the company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 2,260 individual claimants compared to approximately 2,148 individual claimants with actions pending at december 31, 2010."
"  the vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the company allege use of some of the company’s mask and respirator products and seek damages from the company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace."
"a minority of claimants generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at company premises."
"  the company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than its historical experience."
"the company expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past."
"accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other malignancies, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past."
"the company has prevailed in all nine cases taken to trial, including seven of the eight cases tried to verdict, and an appellate reversal in 2005 of the 2001 jury verdict adverse to the company."
"the ninth case, tried in 2009, was dismissed by the court at the close of plaintiff’s evidence, based on the court’s legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict."
"this case is being appealed by the plaintiffs and briefing is complete and the parties are waiting for the court to set a hearing date for oral argument."
"  the company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances."
"consequently the company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the company’s respiratory protection products."
"nonetheless the company’s litigation experience indicates that claims of persons with malignant conditions are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by the unimpaired."
"  plaintiffs have asserted specific dollar claims for damages in approximately 39% of the 1,053 lawsuits that were pending against the company at the end of 2011 in all jurisdictions."
"a majority of states restrict or prohibit specifying damages in tort cases such as these, and most of the remaining jurisdictions do not require such specification."
"in those cases in which plaintiffs choose to assert specific dollar amounts in their complaints, brought in states that permit such pleading, the amounts claimed are typically not meaningful as an indicator of the company’s potential liability."
"of the 410 pending cases in which purported damage amounts are specified in the complaints, 250 cases involve claims of $100,000 or less,  of which also allege punitive damages of $15,000, 15 of which also allege punitive damages of $10 million, and three  of which also allege punitive damages of $20 million) ; 102 cases involve claims between $100,000 and $3 million ; seven  cases involve claims between $3 million and $7."
"5 million ; three  cases involve claims of $10 million  of which also allege punitive damages of $10 million) ; 12 cases involve claims of $50 million ; and 36 cases involve claims of $100 million  of which also alleges punitive damages of $300 million) ."
"some complaints allege that the compensatory and punitive damages are at least the amounts specified."
"as previously stated, the company’s experience and the other reasons cited indicate that the damage amounts specified in complaints are not a meaningful factor in any assessment of the company’s potential liability."
"  as previously reported, the state of west virginia, through its attorney general, filed a complaint in 2003 against the company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the circuit court of lincoln county, west virginia and amended its complaint in 2005."
"the amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the state for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages."
"while the case has been inactive since the fourth quarter of 2007, the court held a case management conference in march 2011, but no further activity has occurred in the case since that conference."
"no liability has been recorded for this matter because the company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time."
"in addition, the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the minimal activity in this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault a jury allocates to each defendant if a case is ultimately tried."
"  100   table of contents   developments may occur that could affect the company’s estimate of its liabilities."
"these developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in  the number of future claims,  the average cost of resolving claims,  the legal costs of defending these claims and in maintaining trial readiness,  changes in the mix and nature of claims received,  trial and appellate outcomes,  changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and  the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers."
"  as a result of the increased costs of aggressively defending itself and the greater cost of resolving claims of persons with malignant conditions, the company increased its reserves in 2011 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $39 million."
"as of december 31, 2011, the company had reserves for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities of $100 million ."
"  as of december 31, 2011, the company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $121 million."
"the company increased its receivables for insurance recoveries by $8 million in 2011 related to this litigation."
"as a result of settlements reached with its insurers, the company was paid approximately $9 million in 2011 in connection with the respirator mask/asbestos litigation."
"  various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this receivable, including  delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers;  the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, and  the outcome of negotiations with insurers and legal proceedings with respect to respirator mask/asbestos liability insurance coverage."
"the difference between the accrued liability and insurance receivable represents in part the time delay between payment of claims on the one hand and receipt of insurance reimbursements on the other hand."
"because of the lag time between settlement and payment of a claim, no meaningful conclusions may be drawn from quarterly or annual changes in the amount of receivables for expected insurance recoveries or changes in the number of claimants."
"  as previously reported, on january 5, 2007 the company was served with a declaratory judgment action filed on behalf of two of its insurers disclaiming coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims."
"these insurers represent approximately $14 million of the $121 million insurance recovery receivable referenced in the above table."
"the action, pending in the district court in ramsey county, minnesota, seeks declaratory judgment regarding coverage provided by the policies and the allocation of covered costs among the policies issued by the various insurers."
"the action named, in addition to the company, over 60 of the company’s insurers."
"this action is similar in nature to an action filed in 1994 with respect to breast implant coverage, which ultimately resulted in the minnesota supreme court’s ruling of 2003 that was largely in the company’s favor."
"the plaintiff insurers have served an amended complaint that names some additional insurers and deletes others."
"a significant number of the insurer defendants named in the amended complaint have been dismissed because of settlements they have reached with 3m regarding the matters at issue in the lawsuit."
"the case is currently in the discovery phase."
"trial is scheduled to begin in the fall of 2012."
"  respirator mask/asbestos litigation — aearo technologies   on april 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the company purchased the stock of aearo holding corp."
", the parent of aearo technologies ."
"aearo manufactures and sells various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products."
"  as of december 31, 2011, the company, through its aearo subsidiary, has recorded $30 million as the best estimate of the probable liabilities for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims."
"responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among aearo, cabot, american optical corporation and a subsidiary of warner lambert and their insurers ."
"liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the “ao safety” brand and/or owned the ao safety division of american   101 table of contents   optical corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff."
"aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between aearo and cabot on july 11, 1995."
"this agreement provides that, so long as aearo pays to cabot an annual fee of $400,000, cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify aearo against, asbestos and silica-related product liability claims for respirators manufactured prior to july 11, 1995."
"because the date of manufacture for a particular respirator allegedly used in the past is often difficult to determine, aearo and cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators while exposed to asbestos or silica or products containing asbestos or silica prior to january 1, 1997."
"with these arrangements in place, aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators while exposed to asbestos, silica or other occupational dusts on or after january 1, 1997."
"  to date, aearo has elected to pay the annual fee."
"aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-july 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with cabot if aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters."
"  developments may occur that could affect the estimate of aearo’s liabilities."
"the company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of aearo’s share of liability for these existing and future claims."
"if any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the reserved amount."
"  because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the payor group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of aearo’s liabilities, the company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which aearo’s liability may exceed the reserve the company has established."
"  environmental matters and litigation   the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private parties in the united states and abroad."
"these laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims."
"the company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities."
"in its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide."
"  under certain environmental laws, including the united states comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980 and similar state laws, the company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations."
"the company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the united states, at which it may have some liability."
"please refer to the paragraph entitled “environmental liabilities and insurance receivables” that follows for information on the amount of the reserve."
"  environmental matters   as previously reported, the company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, national ), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate or “pfoa” and perfluorooctane sulfonate or “pfos” and other perfluorooctanyl compounds."
"as a result of its phase-out decision in may 2000, the company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl compounds."
"the company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement, and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by 2008."
"through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the company’s policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the company has on rare occasion identified the   102 table of contents   presence of precursor chemicals in materials purchased from suppliers that may ultimately degrade to pfoa, pfos or similar compounds."
"upon such identification, the company works to find alternatives for such chemicals."
"  regulatory activities concerning pfoa and/or pfos continue in the united states, europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies."
"these activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches."
"the epa continues to develop drinking water health advisories for pfos and pfoa, which are expected to be released in 2012."
"those advisory levels will supersede the current provisional advisory levels."
"in an effort to move toward developing standards under the safe drinking water act, the epa has proposed to have public water suppliers monitor for six pfcs to determine the extent of their occurrence."
"  in late 2008 and early 2009, the epa undertook testing of private wells and soils at certain agricultural sites in alabama where wastewater treatment sludge was applied from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in decatur, alabama that received wastewater from numerous sources, including sanitary wastewater from 3m."
"in this same timeframe, the epa also issued provisional health advisory values for drinking water for pfoa of 0."
"4 parts per billion and pfos of 0."
"2 ppb."
"pursuant to an information request from epa, a group of local industries, including 3m, and the decatur utility have been working to identify and test private wells in the area, and to connect to municipal water any private wells used for drinking water that exceed the epa’s provisional health advisory levels."
"epa’s and the industry’s testing of public drinking water supplies in the area indicate that the levels of pfoa and pfos in municipal water supplies are well below the provisional health advisories."
"3m and other companies have completed a survey of properties near the sites where decatur utility’s wastewater treatment sludge was applied to identify any additional private drinking water wells not already identified by the epa, and have connected a small number of wells that exceeded the provisional health advisory levels for pfos and pfoa to municipal water."
"3m and the other companies have continued to monitor those few private wells that showed levels of pfos or pfoa above detection levels but below the epa’s provisional health advisory levels."
"epa has notified 3m that the agency is satisfied that 3m has completed its obligations under the information request and that epa is closing its request."
"  the agency for toxic substances and disease registry has completed a bio-monitoring study evaluating pfc blood levels in volunteers living near the sludge application fields."
"the company expects atsdr to release its report in 2012."
"  3m continues its third and final phase of work pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with the epa regarding an environmental assessment program at the company’s decatur manufacturing site."
"that work includes groundwater sampling off-site from the decatur facility as well as at three local landfills used by the facility."
"  the company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of pfc-containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at the cottage grove, minnesota and decatur, alabama plants."
"  as previously reported, the company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the alabama department of environmental management to address the presence of pfcs in the soil at the company’s manufacturing facility in decatur, alabama."
"for approximately twenty years, the company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing pfcs in fields at its decatur facility pursuant to a permit issued by adem."
"after a review of the available options to address the presence of pfcs in the soil, adem agreed that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former sludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment."
"implementation of that option will continue throughout the balance of 2012 and is expected to be completed in 2016."
"  the company continues to work with the minnesota pollution control agency pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed may 2007 settlement agreement and consent order to address the presence of perfluorinated compounds in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in washington county, minnesota and at the company’s manufacturing facility in cottage grove, minnesota."
"during 2008, the mpca issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in washington county, minnesota ."
"in august 2009, the mpca issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the company’s cottage grove manufacturing facility."
"during the spring and summer of 2010, 3m began implementing the remedial options at the cottage grove and woodbury sites."
"3m commenced the remedial option at the oakdale site in late 2010."
"at each location the remedial options were among   103 table of contents   those recommended by the company."
"remediation work has been completed at the oakdale site, and it is in an operational maintenance mode."
"remediation will continue at the other two sites throughout the balance of 2012."
"  the company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions."
"  environmental litigation   as previously reported, a former employee filed a purported class action lawsuit in 2002 in the circuit court of morgan county, alabama seeking unstated damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and property damage from exposure to perfluorochemicals at or near the company’s decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility."
"the circuit court in 2005 granted the company’s motion to dismiss the named plaintiff’s personal injury-related claims on the basis that such claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the state’s workers compensation act."
"the plaintiffs’ counsel filed an amended complaint in november 2006, limiting the case to property damage claims on behalf of a purported class of residents and property owners in the vicinity of the decatur plant."
"also, in 2005, the judge in a second purported class action lawsuit granted the company’s motion to abate the case, effectively putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues in the first action described above filed in the same court in 2002."
"despite the stay, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking damages for alleged personal injuries and property damage on behalf of the named plaintiffs and the members of a purported class."
"no further action in the case is expected unless and until the stay is lifted."
"  in february 2009, a resident of franklin county, alabama, filed a purported class action lawsuit in the circuit court of franklin county seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief based on the application by the decatur utility’s wastewater treatment plant of wastewater treatment sludge to farmland and grasslands in the state that allegedly contain pfoa, pfos and other perfluorochemicals."
"the named defendants in the case include 3m, its subsidiary dyneon llc, daikin america, inc."
", synagro-wwt, inc."
", synagro south, llc and biological processors of america."
"the named plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all persons within the state of alabama who have had pfoa, pfos and other perfluorochemicals released or deposited on their property."
"in march 2010, the alabama supreme court ordered the case transferred from franklin county to morgan county."
"in may, 2010, consistent with its handling of the other matters, the morgan county circuit court abated this case, putting it on hold pending the resolution of the class certification issues in the first case filed there."
"  in march 2011, several residents of lawrence county, alabama, filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of lawrence county seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages and other relief for alleged personal injuries due to the exposure to pfcs."
"the named defendants in the case include the city of decatur, alabama, 3m, its subsidiary dyneon llc, daikin america, inc."
", toray industries, inc."
"and two of its u."
"s."
"subsidiaries, synagro-wwt, inc."
", synagro south, llc and biological processors of america, and certain individuals not associated with 3m."
"according to the complaint, synagro acquired wastewater treatment sludge that allegedly contained pfoa, pfos and other perfluorochemicals from the decatur utility’s wastewater treatment plant, and made it into a fertilizer that it sold to farmers who applied it to their farmland in morgan, limestone and lawrence counties, including land adjacent to the plaintiffs’ residence."
"plaintiffs have dismissed the city of decatur from the case and in december 2011 agreed to settle with 3m for an amount that is not material to the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition."
"the state also seeks declarations under merla that 3m is responsible for all damages the state may suffer in the future for injuries to natural resources from releases of pfcs into the environment, and under mwpca that 3m is responsible for compensation for future loss or destruction of fish, aquatic life and other damages."
"  on january 14, 2011, the city of lake elmo filed a motion to intervene in the state of minnesota lawsuit and seeks damages in excess of $50,000 and other legal and equitable relief, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, for alleged contamination of city property, wells, groundwater and water contained in the wells with pfcs under several theories, including common law and statutory nuisance, strict liability, trespass, negligence, and conversion."
"the court granted the city of lake elmo’s motion to intervene in this lawsuit."
"metropolitan council’s intervention motion was based on several theories, including common law negligence, and statutory claims under merla for response costs and under the minnesota environmental rights act for declaratory and equitable relief against 3m for pfos and other pfc pollution of the waters and sediments of the mississippi river."
"3m did not object to the motion to intervene."
"on january 9, 2012, 3m answered the metropolitan council’s complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging that the metropolitan council discharges pfc’s to the mississippi river and discharges pfc-containing sludge and biosolids from one or more of its wastewater treatment plants onto agricultural lands and local area landfills."
"accordingly, 3m requested that if the court finds that the state is entitled to any of the damages the state seeks, 3m seeks contribution and apportionment from the metropolitan council, including attorneys’ fees, under merla, and contribution from and liability for the metropolitan council’s proportional share of damages awarded to the state under the mwpca, as well as under statutory nuisance and common law theories of trespass, nuisance and negligence."
"3m also seeks declaratory relief under mera."
"  in june 2009, the company, along with more than 250 other companies, was served with a third-party complaint seeking contribution towards the cost of cleaning up a 17-mile stretch of the passaic river in new jersey."
"after commencing an enforcement action in 1990, the state of new jersey filed suit against maxus energy, tierra solutions, occidental chemical and two other companies seeking cleanup and removal costs and other damages associated with the presence of dioxin and other hazardous substances in the sediment of the passaic."
"the third-party complaint seeks to spread those costs among the third-party defendants, including the company."
"based on the cleanup remedy currently proposed by the epa, the total costs at issue could easily exceed $1 billion."
"the company’s recent involvement in the case appears to relate to its past disposal of industrial waste at two commercial waste disposal facilities in new jersey."
"whether, and to what extent, the company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the case remains to be determined."
"the company does not yet have a basis for estimating its potential exposure in this case, although the company currently believes its allocable share, if any, is likely to be a fraction of one percent of the total costs."
"  for environmental litigation matters described in this section for which a liability, if any, has been recorded, the company believes the amount recorded, as well as the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established reserve is not material to the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition."
"for those matters for which a liability has not been recorded, the company believes such liability is not probable and estimable and the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time, with the exception of the passaic river litigation, where the company’s potential exposure, if any, is likely to be a fraction of one percent of the total costs."
"  environmental liabilities and insurance receivables   as of december 31, 2011, the company had recorded liabilities of $28 million for estimated “environmental remediation” costs based upon an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of $15 million."
"the company records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action."
"liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions."
"the company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change."
"the company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years."
"the company expects that most of the spending will occur over the next five years."
"  it is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods."
"for sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental liabilities,” at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including required post-remediation monitoring, the company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition."
"however, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established reserves for the reasons described above."
"  employment litigation   in january 2011, 3m reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs’ counsel to resolve the whitaker and garcia lawsuits."
"the whitaker settlement agreement was signed by all parties in march 2011."
"the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on april 6, 2011, and provisionally certified a class for settlement purposes only."
"the final approval hearing occurred on december 21, 2011 and the court issued its order and judgment on january 5, 2012 approving the settlement."
"the garcia settlement agreement has been signed by the parties."
"all plaintiffs subject to the garcia settlement have signed and not timely revoked individual releases of claims against 3m, and the parties anticipate filing a stipulation of dismissal, with prejudice, in that matter following administration of the settlement, which will occur concurrently with administration of the whitaker settlement."
"if finalized and approved by the court, administration of the settlement agreements will take several months to complete."
"in september 2011, 3m reached an agreement in the form of a proposed consent decree with the u."
"s."
"equal employment opportunity commission to resolve related charges as described below."
"the consent decree was filed concurrently with a complaint in the u."
"s."
"district court for the district of minnesota and has been approved by the court."
"the consent decree addressed the outstanding charges of age discrimination in addition to claims on behalf of a class of certain former employees as defined in the charges and subsequently in the complaint."
"3m agreed, as part of the consent decree, to ensure that its policies and practices further the objectives of equal employment as set forth in the federal age discrimination in employment act and to make certain enhancements in its employee communications and development programs."
"the eeoc agreed, as part of the consent decree, not to take any further action against 3m in connection with the charges and as otherwise set forth in the decree."
"administration of the eeoc settlement is in process and will take several months to complete."
"the amount of each of the proposed settlements is not material to the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition."
"the background of this litigation is set forth below."
"  whitaker lawsuit   as previously reported, in december, 2004, one current and one former employee of the company filed a purported class action in the district court of ramsey county, minnesota, seeking to represent a class of all current and certain former salaried employees employed by the company in minnesota below a certain salary grade who were age 46 or older at any time during the applicable period to be determined by the court ."
"the complaint alleges the plaintiffs suffered various forms of employment discrimination on the basis of age in violation of the minnesota human rights act and seeks injunctive relief, unspecified compensatory damages, including back and front pay, punitive damages and attorneys’ fees."
"  garcia lawsuit   the company was served on may 7, 2009 with a purported class action/collective action age discrimination lawsuit, which was filed in united states district court for the northern district of california, san jose division ."
"the case was subsequently transferred to the u."
"s."
"district court for the district of minnesota."
"the allegations in the garcia lawsuit are similar to those in the whitaker lawsuit."
"  eeoc age-discrimination charges   six former employees and one current employee, all but one of whom are named plaintiffs in the garcia lawsuit, also filed age discrimination charges against the company with the eeoc and various pertinent state agencies, alleging age discrimination similar to the whitaker and garcia lawsuits and claiming that a class of similarly situated persons exists."
"these filings include allegations that the release of claims signed by certain former employees in the purported class defined in the charges is invalid for various reasons and assert age discrimination claims on behalf of certain current and former salaried employees in states other than minnesota and new jersey."
"  106 table of contents   compliance matters   on november 12, 2009, the company contacted the department of justice and securities and exchange commission to voluntarily disclose that the company was conducting an internal investigation as a result of reports it received about its subsidiary in turkey, alleging bid rigging and bribery and other inappropriate conduct in connection with the supply of certain reflective and other materials and related services to turkish government entities."
"the company also contacted certain affected government agencies in turkey."
"the company retained outside counsel to conduct an assessment of its policies, practices, and controls and to evaluate its overall compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act, including an ongoing review of our practices in certain other countries and acquired entities."
"as part of its ongoing review, the company has also reported to the doj and sec issues arising from transactions in other countries."
"the company continues to cooperate with the doj and sec and government agencies in turkey in the company’s ongoing investigation of this matter."
"the company cannot predict at this time the outcome of its investigation or what regulatory actions may be taken or what other consequences may result."
"  other matters   commercial litigation   in september 2010, various parties, on behalf of a purported class of shareholders of cogent, inc."
", commenced three lawsuits against the company, cogent, and its directors in the delaware court of chancery."
"plaintiffs allege that 3m, in connection with its tender offer for cogent shares, aided and abetted the breach of fiduciary duties by cogent directors and seek an unspecified amount of damages."
"the three cases were consolidated, expedited discovery was conducted, and plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the acquisition was denied on october 1, 2010."
"on november 15, 2010, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added cogent directors appointed by 3m, as named defendants, and asserted additional claims of breach of fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition and a subsequent offering period."
"3m completed its acquisition of cogent in december 2010."
"3m moved to dismiss all claims."
"in response to 3m’s motion, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in august 2011."
"3m has moved to dismiss all claims of the second amended complaint."
"  in september 2010, various parties, again on behalf of a purported class of cogent shareholders, commenced six lawsuits against the company, cogent and its directors in the los angeles superior court for the state of california that contained similar claims that 3m had aided and abetted the breach of fiduciary duties by cogent directors."
"the parties have reached a resolution of these matters."
"a separate lawsuit was commenced in september 2010 by an individual, again on behalf of a purported class of cogent shareholders, against cogent and its directors in the united states district court for the central district of california that raised similar claims; plaintiff later filed an amended complaint that also named the company."
"the plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed that lawsuit."
"  separately, several purported holders of cogent shares, representing a total of approximately 5."

"during 2008 the board of directors approved various changes to the employee savings plans."
"for substantially all employees hired prior to january 1, 2009, employee 401  contributions of up to 6% of eligible compensation are matched at rates of 60% or 75%, depending on the plan the employee participated in."
"employees hired on or after january 1, 2009 receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401  contributions of up to 6% of eligible compensation and also receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s total eligible compensation."
"all contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to their elections."

"total esop shares were considered to be shares outstanding for earnings per share calculations."
"the esop debt matured in 2009."
"  dividends on shares held by the esop were paid to the esop trust and, together with company contributions, were used by the esop to repay principal and interest on the outstanding esop debt."
"the tax benefit related to dividends paid on unallocated shares was charged directly to equity and totaled approximately $1 million in 2009."
"over the life of the esop debt, shares were released for allocation to participants based on the ratio of the current year’s debt service to the remaining debt service prior to the current payment."
"  until 2009, the esop was the primary funding source for the company’s employee savings plans."
"as permitted by accounting standards relating to employers’ accounting for employee stock ownership plans, the debt of the esop was recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral were reported as unearned compensation in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of changes in equity."
"unearned compensation was reduced symmetrically as the esop made principal payments on the debt."
"expenses related to the esop included total debt service on the notes, less dividends."

"in may 2010, shareholders approved an additional 29 million shares for issuance under the 2008 plan, increasing the number of approved shares from 35 million to 64 million shares."

"  the company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in february to provide a strong and immediate link between the performance of individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants."
"the grant to eligible employees uses the closing stock price on the grant date."
"stock options vest over a period from one to three years with the expiration date at 10 years from date of grant."
"accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire."
"employees are considered eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed five years of service."
"this retiree-eligible population represents 28 percent of the 2011 annual stock-based compensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter."
"beginning in 2007, the company reduced the number of traditional stock options granted under the msop plan by reducing the number of employees eligible to receive annual grants and by shifting a portion of the annual grant away from traditional stock options primarily to restricted stock units."
"however, associated with the reduction in the number of eligible employees, the company provided a one-time “buyout” grant in 2007 of restricted stock units to the impacted employees."
"3m also has granted progressive options."
"these options are nonqualified stock options that were granted to certain participants under the 1997 or 2002 msop, but for which the reload feature was eliminated in 2005 ."
"participants who had options granted prior to this effective date may still qualify to receive new progressive stock options."
"  in addition to the annual grants, the company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants."
"the company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries."
"these grants do not result in the issuance of common stock and are considered immaterial by the company."

"the number of shares of 3m common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from 0% to 200% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the company during such performance period."
"non-substantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each individual became a 3m executive."
"the first performance shares, which were granted in 2008, were distributed in 2011."
"performance shares do not accrue dividends during the performance period."
"therefore, the grant date fair value is determined by reducing the closing stock price on the date of grant by the net present value of dividends during the performance period."
"as a result of the significant uncertainty due to the economic crisis of 2008-2009, the company granted restricted stock units instead of performance shares in 2009."
