"polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers."
"we focus on the higher‑margin, higher‑growth markets for specialty mdi and mdi‑based polyurethane systems."
"growth in our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of mdi‑based products for other materials across a broad range of applications."
"we operate six primary polyurethane manufacturing facilities in the u."
"s."
", europe and china."
"we also operate 20 strategically located downstream polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemical industry as “systems houses,” located in close proximity to our customers worldwide, which enables us to focus on customer support, technical service and a differentiated product offering."
"we also operate a specialty polyol manufacturing facility focused on the insulation market and three downstream tpu manufacturing facilities in the u."
"s."
", europe and china."
"our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate, such as mdi, with polyols, which are derived largely from po and eo."
"we are able to produce over 2,000 distinct mdi‑based polyurethane products by modifying the mdi molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations."
"as a result, polyurethane products, especially those derived from mdi, are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end‑use markets, including insulation in construction and appliances, cushioning for automotive and furniture, coatings, adhesives, wood binders for construction and furniture, footwear and other specialized engineering applications."
"we are one of three north american producers of po."
"we and some of our customers process po into derivative products, such as polyols for polyurethane products, pg and various other chemical products."
"end uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings, construction, appliances, packaging, automotive and transportation, food, paints and coatings and cleaning products industries."
"we also produce mtbe as a co‑product of our po manufacturing process."
"mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline."
"see “—item 1a."
"risk factors."
"” in 1992, we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china."
"we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated polyurethanes formulation facility and a world scale research and development campus."
"in january 2003, we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production and finishing facilities near shanghai, china in caojing."
"in june 2006, hps, a consolidated joint venture, began production at our mdi finishing plant."
"in september 2006, slic, an unconsolidated joint venture, began production at the mnb, aniline and crude mdi plants."
"we are in the process of expanding the capacity of these facilities and expect beneficial commercial operations during the first quarter of 2018."
"these world‑scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical chinese market, the largest mdi market in the world, and will support the long‑term demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience."
"additionally, in november 2012, we entered into an agreement with sinopec to form a joint venture to build a world scale po/mtbe plant in nanjing, china utilizing our proprietary po/mtbe manufacturing technology."
"the facility was completed in early 2017 and beneficial commercial operations began in the second half of 2017."
"we own a 49% interest in the joint venture and account for our interest in the joint venture as an equity method investment."
"6   table of contents products and markets mdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized, higher‑value flexible foam as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers."
"polyols, including polyether and polyester polyols, are used in conjunction with mdi in rigid foam, flexible foam and other non‑foam applications."
"po is one of the principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols."
"the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals."
"polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products."
"depending on their needs, customers will use either component polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements."
"by varying the blend, additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals, manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products."
"our strategy is focused on growing our differentiated product offering, which requires a greater emphasis on formulating capability to provide our downstream customers with the end effect required in their applications these differentiated products tend to require technical solutions, offer higher margins, lower volatility and are less dependent on industry utilization rates compared to sales of component mdi or component polyols."
"mdi."
" mdi has grown substantially over the past three decades, increasing by a factor of 6% to 7% cagr, well in excess of global gdp."
"mdi has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than other polyurethane isocyanates."
"this is primarily because mdi can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications."
"we believe that mdi and formulated mdi systems, which combine mdi and polyols, will continue to grow at approximately double the rate of global gdp driven by the mega trends of energy management, food preservation, demographics and urbanization/transportation."
"mdi offers key products benefits of energy efficiency, comfort and durability aligned with these megatrends."
"we believe that mdi and formulated mdi systems will continue to substitute for alternative materials such as fiberglass in insulation, phenol formaldehyde in wood binders and tdi in automotive and furniture."
"specialty cushioning and insulation applications, thermoplastic polyurethanes and adhesives and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of mdi."
"mdi experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction‑related end markets such as insulation and composite wood products."
"sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year."
"tpu."
" tpu is a high‑quality, fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability, flexibility, strength, abrasion‑resistance, shock absorbency and chemical resistance."
"we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to meet the specific requirements of our customers."
"tpu is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear 7   table of contents industries."
"it is also extruded into films for apparel, wires and cables for industrial use and in a wide variety of applications in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets."
"polyols."
" polyols are combined with mdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of formulated polyurethane systems."
"demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown."
"aniline."
" aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi."
"the majority of our aniline is consumed internally with some sold to third parties."
"we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive, mdi manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long‑term, cost‑competitive aniline supply contract."
"po."
" po is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and pg."
"demand for po depends largely on overall economic demand, especially that of consumer durables."
"strategically, we use po produced at our world scale po/mtbe facility in port neches, texas, downstream in our formulated mdi systems."
"we also constructed a po/mtbe facility in nanjing, china with the strategic aim of supplying po downstream into our china business, accelerating our differentiated growth in the world’s largest pu market."
"in addition, we also have an important internal strategic outlet for po, downstream into our performance products amines business, which generates significant added value to the po molecule."
"mtbe."

" amines are a family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene derivatives."
"generally, amines are valued for their properties as a reactive agent, emulsifier, dispersant, solvent or corrosion inhibitor."
"growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with gdp growth."
"however, certain segments of the amines market, such as polyetheramines, have historically grown at rates in excess of gdp growth due to new product development, technical innovation and end‑use substitution."
"as amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer‑specific end‑use applications, pricing does not 12   table of contents generally fluctuate directly with movements in underlying raw materials."
"they provide sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations, enabling customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials."
"our ethyleneamines are manufactured by reacting edc and caustic soda with ammonia to produce a range of various ethyleneamines homologues having different molecular weights."
"most other producers utilize a reductive amination process, which yields a light slate of ethyleneamines."
"we believe our heavier slate of homologues allows access to a greater range of markets."
"ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of eo with ammonia."
"there are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry."

"our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed butane process with solvent."
"we believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock, energy efficiency and solvent recovery."
"the maleic anhydride‑based route to bdo manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes, which include po, butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks."
"as a result, the growth in demand for bdo has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst."
"generally, changes in price have resulted from a combination of changes in industry capacity utilization and underlying raw material costs."
"we license our maleic anhydride technology and supply our catalysts to licensees and to worldwide merchant customers."
"revenue from licensing and catalyst comes from new plant commissioning, as well as current plant retrofits and catalyst change schedules."
"our licensing group also licenses technology on behalf of other performance products businesses and other segments."
"our key maleic anhydride customers include aoc, ashland, chevron oronite, cranston, dixie, ingevity, lubrizol, mfg chemical, polynt-reichhold and tate & lyle."

"there can be no assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know‑how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know‑how."
"in addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means."
"in addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know‑how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets, know‑how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities."

"in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities."
"in addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation."
"actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, or injunctions limiting or prohibiting our operations altogether."
"in addition, some environmental laws may impose liability on a strict, joint and several basis."
"moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations and make significant environmental compliance expenditures."
"accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities."
"information related to environmental, health and safety matters may also be found in other areas of this report including “—item 1a."

"environmental, health and safety systems we are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable ehs legal requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants."
"we cannot guarantee, however, that these policies and systems will always be effective or that we will be able to manage ehs legal requirements without incurring substantial costs."
"although ehs legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us."
"environmental remediation we have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials."
"similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses."
"under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources."
"in cases where our potential liability arises from historical contamination based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility, we frequently obtain an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre‑closing conditions."
"we have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liability."
"we cannot assure you, however, that the liabilities for all such matters subject to indemnity will be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters."
"based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements."
"however, if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs, then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements."
"at the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to remediate contaminated sites."
"regulatory matters greenhouse gas regulation and climate change globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth’s climate."
"at the durban negotiations of the conference of the parties to the kyoto protocol in 2012, a limited group of nations, 24   table of contents including the european union, agreed to a second commitment period for the kyoto protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in ghg emissions."
"more significantly, the eu ghg emissions trading system, established pursuant to the kyoto protocol to reduce ghg emissions in the eu, continues in its third phase."
"the eu parliament has used a process to formalize “backloading”—the withholding of ghg allowances during the trading period from 2014 to 2016 with additional allowances auctioned during 2019 to 2020—to prop up carbon prices."
"as backloading is only a temporary measure, a sustainable solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ets."
"the european commission proposes to establish a market stability reserve to address the current surplus of allowances and improve the system’s resilience."
"the reserve will start operating in 2019."
"in addition, the eu has announced the binding target to reduce domestic ghg emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030."
"the eu has set a binding target of increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the eu’s energy consumption by 2030, and additional proposals have been made to increase the target to 35%."
"in addition, at the 2015 united nations framework convention on climate change in paris, the u."
"s."
"and nearly 200 other nations entered into an international climate agreement, which entered into effect in november 2016 ."
"although the agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their ghg emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions."
"however, in august 2017 the u."
"s."
"informed the united nations that it is withdrawing from the paris agreement."
"the paris agreement provides for a four year exit process."
"federal climate change legislation in the u."
"s."
"appears unlikely in the near‑term."
"as a result, domestic efforts to curb ghg emissions will continue to be led by the u."
"s."
"environmental protection agency’s ghg regulations and similar programs of certain states."
"to the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the epa’s ghg regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities."
"significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act’s requirements for pollutants regulated under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs."
"some of our facilities are also subject to the epa’s mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs."
"we are already managing and reporting ghg emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to u."
"s."
"federal and state requirements, kyoto protocol obligations and/or ets requirements."
"although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time."
"potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet ghg emission restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs."
"currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites."
"finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events."
"if any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations."

"  risk factors any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity."
"risks related to our business our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with volatile economic conditions."
"our financial results are substantially dependent on overall economic conditions in the u."
"s."
", europe and asia."
"declining economic conditions in all or any of these locations—or negative perceptions about economic conditions—could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could adversely affect our business."
"the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain, and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time."
"uncertain economic conditions and market instability make it particularly difficult for us to forecast demand trends."
"as a consequence, we may not be able to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial condition or results of operations."
"we can give no assurances as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the industries in which we operate."
"the markets for many of our products are cyclical and volatile, and we may experience depressed market conditions for such products."
"the cyclicality that the markets for many of our products experience occurs as a result of alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and margins to increase, followed by periods of lower capacity utilization, resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins."
"the volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of changes in the demand for products as a consequence of global economic activity, changes in energy prices and changes in customers’ requirements."
"for example, demand for our products depends in part on the housing and construction industries, which are cyclical in nature and have historically been impacted by downturns in the economy."
"in addition, margins for mtbe sales are volatile and seasonal."
"the supply‑demand balance is also impacted by capacity additions or reductions that result in changes in utilization rates."
"the cyclicality and volatility of our industry results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle."
"disruptions in production at our manufacturing facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition."
"manufacturing facilities in our industry are subject to planned and unplanned production shutdowns, turnarounds, outages and other disruptions."
"any serious disruption at any of our facilities could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses."
"alternative facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to increase production or qualify with our customers, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of 26   table of contents operations and/or financial condition."
"long‑term production disruptions may cause our customers to seek alternative supply which could further adversely affect our profitability."
"unplanned production disruptions may occur for external reasons including natural disasters, weather, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism, or internal reasons, such as fire, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems."
"any such production disruption could have a material impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition."
"in addition, we rely on a number of vendors, suppliers, and in some cases sole‑source suppliers, service providers, toll manufacturers and collaborations with other industry participants to provide us with chemicals, feedstocks and other raw materials, along with energy sources and, in certain cases, facilities that we need to operate our business."
"if the business of these third parties is disrupted, some of these companies could be forced to reduce their output, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection."
"if this were to occur, it could adversely affect their ability to provide us with the raw materials, energy sources or facilities that we need, which could materially disrupt our operations, including the production of certain of our products."
"moreover, it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases."
"all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity."
"while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters or from events that might increase in frequency or intensity due to climate change."
"in addition, insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters."
"in areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters, insurance may become increasingly expensive or not available at all."
"furthermore, some potential climate‑driven losses, particularly inundation due to sea‑level rise, may pose long‑term risks to our physical facilities such that operations cannot be restored in their current locations."
"our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, legal restrictions and taxes."
"we conduct a majority of our business operations outside the u."
"s."
", and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with international operations."
"these risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates."
"we transact business in many foreign currencies, including euros, swiss francs, chinese renminbi, indian rupees, brazilian reals and thai bahts."
"we translate our local currency financial results into u."
"s."
"dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period."
"during times of a strengthening u."

"dollar, our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer u."
"s."
"dollars."
"because we currently have significant operations located outside the u."
"s."
", we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements."
"other risks of international operations include trade barriers, tariffs, exchange controls, cash repatriation restrictions, national and regional labor strikes, social and political risks, general economic risks and required compliance with a variety of u."
"s."
"and foreign laws, including monetary policies, tax laws, the foreign corrupt practices act, export controls and regulations administered by the office of foreign assets control."
"any changes in tariffs or trade barriers could make our products less competitive compared to other producers not subject to the same tariffs or trade barriers."
"any decision to repatriate cash as dividends could subject us to foreign and u."
"s."
" federal and state income taxes without any offsetting foreign tax credit relief."
"although we maintain an anti‑corruption compliance program throughout our company, violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business."
"furthermore, in foreign jurisdictions where legal processes may vary from country to country, we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements."
"in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices vary, we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems."
"the occurrence of these risks, among others, could disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries, which could significantly affect their ability to make distributions to us."
"we operate in a significant number of jurisdictions, which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate."
"changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate."
"in addition, generally accepted accounting principles in the u."
"s."
"have required us to place valuation allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in a significant number of tax jurisdictions."
"these valuation allowances result from analysis of positive and negative evidence supporting the 27   table of contents realization of tax benefits."
"negative evidence includes a cumulative history of pre‑tax operating losses in specific tax jurisdictions."
"changes in valuation allowances have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate."
"economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of current valuation allowances and, potentially, the establishment of new valuation allowances."
"while significant valuation allowances remain, our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant fluctuations."
"furthermore, certain foreign jurisdictions may take actions to delay our ability to collect value‑added tax refunds."
"our efforts to grow and transform our businesses may require significant investments; if our strategies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected."
"we continuously evaluate opportunities for growth and change."
"these initiatives may involve making acquisitions, entering into partnerships and joint ventures, divesting assets, restructuring our existing operations and assets, creating new financial structures and building new facilities—any of which could require a significant investment and subject us to new kinds of risks."
"we have incurred indebtedness to finance these opportunities, and we may incur additional indebtedness to finance future initiatives."
"we could also issue additional shares of stock of our company or our subsidiaries to finance such initiatives."
"if our strategies for growth and change are not successful, we could face increased financial pressure, such as increased cash flow demands, reduced liquidity and diminished access to financial markets, and the equity value of our businesses could be diluted."

"28   table of contents significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers, which could reduce our profitability."
"we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials from third‑party suppliers and the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses."
"the prices for a number of these raw materials generally follow price trends of, and vary with market conditions for, crude oil and natural gas feedstocks, which are highly volatile and cyclical."
"for example, the market for crude oil and natural gas feedstocks experienced depressed pricing throughout 2015 and 2016, leading to favorable prices for the raw materials that we purchase from third parties."
"lower raw material prices, however, can lead to downward pressure on selling prices for certain of our products leading to reduced revenue."
"our supply agreements typically provide for market‑based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility."
"while we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases, we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all."
"timing differences between raw material prices, which may change daily, and contract product prices, which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow."
"any cost increase that we are not able to pass on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity."
"in general, the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are organic chemical commodity products that are readily available at market prices."
"there are, however, several raw materials for which there are only a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier."
"to mitigate potential supply constraints, we frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers, evaluate alternative sources of supply and evaluate alternative technologies to avoid reliance on limited or sole‑source suppliers."
"in addition, where supply relationships are concentrated, particular attention is paid by the parties to ensure strategic intentions are aligned to facilitate long‑term planning."
"if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs."
"any interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues, which could reduce our cash flow."
"the inability of a supplier to meet our raw material needs could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and results of operations."
"the number of sources for and availability of certain raw materials is also specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is located."
"political and economic instability in the countries from which we purchase our raw material supplies could adversely affect their availability."
"in addition, if raw materials become unavailable within a geographic area from which they are now sourced, then we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost effective substitutes."
"we may also experience higher operating costs such as energy costs, which could affect our profitability."
"we may not always be able to increase our selling prices to offset the impact of any higher production costs or reduced production levels, which could reduce our earnings and decrease our liquidity."

"changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our competitive position in various products and markets throughout the world."
"some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can."
"furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development."
"while we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and processes, to improve and refine existing products and processes, and to develop new applications for existing products, the failure to develop new products, processes or applications could make us less competitive."
"moreover, if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete."
"in addition, certain of our competitors in various countries in which we do business, including china, may be owned by or affiliated with members of local governments and political entities."

"and mexico, which in the aggregate total hundreds of millions of dollars."
"we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales in the regions that would be impacted by brexit and a reversal of nafta."
"approximately 25% of our revenues stem from sales in europe and 41% from sales in north america."
"the consequences of brexit and a reversal of nafta, depending upon what the terms and conditions of such events are, together with what may be protracted negotiations in both cases, could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate."
"brexit or a reversal of nafta could also create uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our customers in these regions are subject and lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the u."

"government determines which eu laws to replace or replicate or as members of nafta pursue other trade partners and adopt laws and regulations that are less harmonious with those of existing nafta members."
"while we are not experiencing any immediate adverse impact on our financial condition as a result of brexit or the nafta negotiations, adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations, operating results and financial condition."

"our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs, which could reduce our profitability."
"although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of chemical and other products."
"these hazards include: chemical spills, pipeline leaks and ruptures, storage tank leaks, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing, processing, handling, transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals."
"we are also potentially subject to other hazards, including natural disasters and severe weather; explosions and fires; transportation problems, including interruptions, spills and leaks; mechanical failures; unscheduled downtimes; labor difficulties; remediation complications; and other risks."
"in addition, some equipment and operations at our facilities are owned or controlled by third parties who may not be fully integrated into our safety programs and over whom we are able to exercise limited control."
"many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities."
"furthermore, we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure, exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby, workers’ compensation and other matters."
"we maintain property, business interruption, products liability and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, as well as insurance policies covering other types of risks, including pollution legal liability insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business."
"each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry standards and practices."
"as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage."
"if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity."
"in addition, we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business."
"we are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings."
"for more information, see “—item 3."

"31   table of contents we are subject to many ehs regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability."
"we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials."
"actual or alleged violations of ehs laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some ehs laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability."
"many of our products and operations are subject to the chemical control laws of the countries in which they are located."
"these laws include the regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the toxic substances control act in the u."
"s."
"and the registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals and the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures regulations in europe."
"analogous regimes exist in other parts of the world, including china, south korea, and taiwan."
"in addition, a number of countries where we operate, including the u."
"k."
", have adopted rules to conform chemical labeling in accordance with the globally harmonized system."
"many of these foreign regulatory regimes are in the process of a multi‑year implementation period for these rules."
"additional new laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally."
"for example, in the u."
"s."
", the epa finalized revisions to its risk management program in january 2017."
"the revisions include new requirements for certain facilities to perform hazard analyses, third‑party auditing, incident investigations and root cause analyses, emergency response exercises, and to publically share chemical and process information."
"compliance for many of the rule’s new requirements will be required beginning in 2021."
"the epa has proposed to delay the rule’s effect until february 2019; however, epa’s proposed delay has been challenged in the courts by environmental groups."
"the u."
"s."
"occupational safety and health administration had previously announced that it was considering changes to its process safety management standards that parallel epa’s risk management program; but additional action appears unlikely at this time."
"in addition, tsca reform legislation was enacted in june 2016, and the epa has begun the process of issuing new chemical control regulations."
"epa issued several final rules in 2017 under the revised tsca related to existing chemicals, including the following: a rule to establish epa’s process and criteria for identifying chemicals for risk evaluation; a rule to establish epa’s process for evaluating high priority chemicals and their uses to determine whether or not they present an unreasonable risk to health or the environment; and a rule to require industry reporting of chemicals manufactured or processed in the u."
"s."
"over the past 10 years."
"the epa has also released its draft framework for approving new chemicals and new uses of existing chemicals."
"under the draft framework, which is already being used by epa in tsca evaluations, a new chemical or use presents an unreasonable risk if it exceeds set standards."
"such a finding could result in either the issuance of rules restricting the use of the chemical being evaluated or in the need for additional testing."
"the costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined."
"furthermore, governmental, regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry."
"in addition, these concerns could influence public perceptions regarding our products and operations, the viability of certain products, our reputation, the cost to comply with regulations, and the ability to attract and retain employees."
"moreover, changes in ehs regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations."
"accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability."
"for example, several of our products are being evaluated under reach and clp regulations and actions thereunder could negatively impact sales."
"we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future ehs laws."
"capital expenditures and costs relating to ehs matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations."
"capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future ehs laws."
"furthermore, we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off‑site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials, or from disposal activities that pre‑dated our purchase of our businesses."
"we may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future ehs laws."
"32   table of contents regulatory requirements to reduce ghg emissions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations."
"our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of ghgs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth’s climate."
"there are existing efforts to address ghg emissions at the international, national, and regional levels."
"for example, the 2015 paris climate summit agreement, which entered into force in november 2016, resulted in voluntary commitments by numerous countries to reduce their ghg emissions."
"however, the u."
"s."
"notified the united nations in august 2017 that it will be withdrawing from the agreement, which provides for a four year exit process."
"the eu also regulates ghgs under the eu ets and china has established its own country-wide ghg cap and trade program."
"domestically, the epa issued its final clean power plan rules in 2015 that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called co2 emission performance rates."
"this rule has been challenged in court and the epa has separately announced that it intends to repeal and potentially replace the clean power plan."
"in any event, collectively, these rules and agreements may affect the long term price and supply of electricity and natural gas and demand for products that contribute to energy efficiency and renewable energy."
"these various regulations and agreements are likely to result in increased costs to purchased energy, additional capital costs for installation or modification of ghg emitting equipment, and additional costs associated directly with ghg emissions, which are primarily related to energy use."
"compliance with these regulations and any more stringent restrictions in the future may increase our operational costs."
"in addition, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events."
"if any such effects were to occur in areas where we or our clients operate, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations."
"we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future ehs laws."
"capital expenditures and costs relating to ehs matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations."

"our operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected by legal claims against us, including antitrust claims."
"we face risks arising from various legal actions, including matters relating to antitrust, product liability, intellectual property and environmental claims."
"it is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others for which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity, or which may be beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters."
"over the past few years, antitrust claims have been made against chemical companies."
"in this type of litigation, the plaintiffs generally seek treble damages, which may be significant."
"an adverse outcome in any antitrust claim could be material and significantly impact our operations, financial condition and liquidity."
"financial difficulties and related problems experienced by our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business."
"during periods of economic disruption, more of our customers than normal may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations, which could affect our business by reducing sales, increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing our profitability."
"a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer’s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer."
"33   table of contents our business is dependent on our intellectual property."

"while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the u."
"s."
", there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable."
"furthermore, if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent, or if patents are issued to us, but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property, then our ability to compete may be adversely affected."
"additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity."
"we also rely upon unpatented proprietary know‑how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position."
"while it is our policy to enter into agreements imposing confidentiality obligations upon our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, these confidentiality obligations may be breached, may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know‑how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our trade secrets and know‑how."
"in addition, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means."
"we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights."
"we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or infringement in countries where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and judicial systems may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as u."
"s."
"law."
"the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know‑how or the failure of adequate legal remedies for related actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity."
"conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks, political events and general instability, along with increased security regulations related to our industry, could adversely affect our business."
"conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and political events have precipitated economic instability and turmoil in international commerce and the global economy."
"the uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from hostilities, military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our facilities and operations or those of our suppliers or customers."
"accordingly, any conflict, military action or terrorist attack that impacts us or any of our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity."
"furthermore, instability and turmoil, particularly in energy‑producing nations, may result in raw material cost increases."
"changes in social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop and sell products, could adversely affect our business."
"for example, a number of governments have instituted regulations attempting to increase the security of chemical plants and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result in higher operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity."
"if our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us, then we will not be able to make payment on our debts."
"our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of huntsman international and our guarantor subsidiaries."
"because a significant portion of our operations are conducted by nonguarantor subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of such debt at maturity, are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such nonguarantor subsidiaries."
"any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our nonguarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our nonguarantor subsidiaries."
"in addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings."
"our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and, except for our guarantor subsidiaries, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any funds available for those amounts, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, our 34   table of contents debt."
"any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary."

"in 2017, china announced that it would implement a mandate to use gasoline containing 10% ethanol by 2020."
"if implemented, ethanol could substitute mtbe and other blendstocks in the chinese market."
"expansion of our po/mtbe operations, including our joint venture with sinopec in china, further exposes us to these risks."
"while we could use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe, this would require significant capital expenditures to modify our facilities."
"moreover, the sale of other products would produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe."
"our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations are currently underfunded, and under certain circumstances we may have to significantly increase the level of cash funding to some or all of these plans, which would reduce the cash available for our business."
"we have unfunded and underfunded obligations under some of our domestic and foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans."
"the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rates used to determine pension obligations."
"unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which would reduce the cash available for our business."
"in addition, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years."
"with respect to our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans, the pension benefit guaranty corporation has the authority to terminate an underfunded tax‑qualified pension plan under limited circumstances in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended."
"in the event our tax‑qualified pension plans are terminated by the pbgc, we could be liable to the pbgc for the entire amount of the underfunding and, under certain circumstances, the liability could be senior to our notes."
"with respect to our foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans, the effects of underfunding depend on the country in which the pension and postretirement benefit plan is established."
"for example, in the u."

"we believe that net income of huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with u."

" gaap that is most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda."
"we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing the businesses’ ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the businesses’ operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends."
"however, this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income of huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u."
"s."
" gaap."
"moreover, adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation."
"our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions."
"adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry."
"for example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings."
"therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies."
"in addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate."
"as a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies."
"finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets."
"this can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies."
"nevertheless, our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income of huntsman corporation or huntsman 50   table of contents international, as appropriate, which reflects overall financial performance."
"for example, we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations and interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue."

"in addition to the limitations noted above, adjusted ebitda excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance."
"however, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of future results."

"adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental information."
"the income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach."

"deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes."
"we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized."
"valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction."
"these conclusions require significant judgment."
"in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period."
"cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future."

"  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return."
"the application of income tax law is inherently complex."
"we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more‑likely‑than‑not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit."
"this requires us to make significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law."
"additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more‑likely‑than‑not we are required to make judgments and apply assumptions in order to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize."
"these judgments are based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities."
"interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time."

"the estimated lives of our property range from 3 to 50 years and depreciation is recorded on the straight‑line method."
"inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures will be performed."
"without on‑going capital improvements and maintenance, the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would be shorter."
"management uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long‑lived assets."
"at december 31, 2017, if the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment had either been one year greater or one year less than their recorded lives, then depreciation expense for 2017 would have been approximately $35 million less or $41 million greater, respectively."
"we are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long‑lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable in the future or when management’s plans change regarding those assets, such as idling or closing a plant."
"we evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related asset groups that are largely independent of the cash flows of other asset groups to their carrying values."
"key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life, technology, competitive pressures, raw material pricing and regulations."

"asset retirement obligations are accrued at estimated fair value."
"when the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long‑lived asset."

"carrying value of long‑lived assets we review long‑lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable."
"recoverability is based upon current and anticipated undiscounted cash flows, and we recognize an impairment when such estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset."
"measurement of the amount of impairment, if any, is based upon the difference between carrying value and fair value."

"changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain international operations are recorded in other comprehensive income, to the extent effective."
"the effectiveness of a cash flow hedging relationship is established at the inception of the hedge, and after inception we perform effectiveness assessments at least every three months."
"a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is determined to be effective if the change in value of the hedge divided by the change in value of the hedged item is within a range of 80% to 125%."
"hedge ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedge occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction."
